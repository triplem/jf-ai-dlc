// harness/codex/manifest.ts — the Codex CLI distribution row.
//
// Projects core/ into dist/codex/.codex/ (rules → aidlc-rules, D-10) and defers
// every codex-specific surface to emit.ts (config.toml, hooks.json, trust-seed,
// AGENTS.md, 14 agent TOMLs, the .agents/skills/ tree). Mirrors the proven
// package-codex.ts spike, generalized onto the unified packager.
//
// Codex specifics vs Claude/Kiro:
//   - token → .codex
//   - rules/ → aidlc-rules/ (Codex's native .codex/rules/ is Starlark
//     permission rules; the AIDLC markdown layers live in aidlc-rules/)
//   - skills are NOT shipped in .codex/skills/ — Codex discovers skills at
//     <project>/.agents/skills/, so skipRunnerGen is set and emit() composes
//     the whole skill set (orchestrator + runners + session skills) there.
//   - the only authored .codex/ file is the aidlc-codex-adapter.ts stdin shim
//     (a harnessFile); the agent TOMLs in .codex/agents/ are emitted.
