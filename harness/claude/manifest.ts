// harness/claude/manifest.ts — the Claude Code distribution row.
//
// One core, N harnesses (dist-unified). This manifest tells scripts/package.ts
// how to project the harness-neutral core/ tree into dist/claude/.claude/:
//   - the harness directory token substitution ({{HARNESS_DIR}} → .claude)
//   - the per-dir map (core/<src> → <harnessDir>/<dst>); Claude renames nothing
//   - which authored files live in harness/claude/ and where they land
//
// Claude is a peer harness, not the identity transform: its prose carries the
// same {{HARNESS_DIR}} token as every other harness; the packager substitutes
// `.claude` here. Because that substitution restores exactly today's `.claude/`
// literals, the regenerated dist/claude is byte-identical to the hand-authored
// tree it replaces (the MR-1 keystone gate).
