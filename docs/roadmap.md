# AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 - Roadmap

Status as of 2026-08-20.

- The current v2 version is **2.6.18** (`origin/v2` tip `fbb1460c`). Version
  numbers describe the committed framework tree;
  they are not GitHub Releases.
- AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 is **GA**. The README announcement landed in #627 after
  the reviewer-as-verifier and three-role ensemble milestones shipped.
- Release publication is not yet aligned with the v2 branch: GitHub still marks
  `v1.0.1` as Latest, tracked by #635. The native distribution implementation
  for #722 is under review in #756; no public v2 native release exists yet.
- PR validation now includes the deterministic integration and end-to-end tiers
  in addition to smoke, unit, packaging, typecheck and lint (#791).

The version numbers below describe where work landed on the v2 branch. Future
themes and open pull requests are directional, not committed release promises.

## North star reference

The seven functional goals of the AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 North Star, verbatim in intent:

1. **Mimic what we practice in the real world** - a stage executed by a
   configurable ensemble (Owner, Collaborator, Verifier) with consistent
   semantics across harnesses.
2. **Customization of behaviour** - encode new behaviours, policies, or
   constraints in no more than two targeted changes, reusable across harnesses
   without tool-specific rewrites.
3. **Adaptiveness of workflows** - scale in (report triage to compact Fix, Test,
   PR) and scale out (decide next stages at boundaries); composition not
   hard-wired.
4. **Verifier as a true adversary** - adversarial quality gate; may use a
   different LLM than the producer; validates against machine-checkable
   evidence; budgeted self-heal loop escalating to HITL.
5. **Support for cyclic, directional flows** - forward progression plus
   governed, directional feedback loops.
6. **Preserve artefact traceability** - downstream stages enrich upstream
   artefacts rather than spawning disconnected ones.
7. **Organizational, not project-local, artefact repository** - shared org
   knowledge layer across projects, intents, and repos; six named scenarios.

## Strategic delivery pillars

Two strategic pillars shape how the North Star reaches users and evolves:

- **Productization and distribution (#722)** - make AI-DLC straightforward to
  install, configure, upgrade, release and roll back across supported harnesses.
- **Plugin ecosystem and marketplace (#723)** - make trusted extensions
  discoverable, installable and reusable, with a clear path from external plugin
  to first-party capability.

## Directional themes

These themes are supported by open RFCs, issues or implementation pull requests,
but do not yet have committed release versions.

### Traceability and progressive enrichment

- Per-stage upstream traceability enforcement shipped in
  [#401](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/401). Bind review evidence
  to source state
  ([#646](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/646)), and propagate
  stale stage results
  ([#716](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/716)).
- Per-unit attribution for Code Generation review receipts is active in
  [#813](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/813), addressing
  [#662](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/662). A fresh v2
  implementation is still needed for cross-unit discovery propagation
  ([#299](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/299)/[#300](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/300)).
- Preserve progressive enrichment as the North Star destination: downstream
  stages enrich upstream artefacts in place, with ADRs as a core design artefact.
- Commit-level provenance remains an open design question; the current audit
  chain does not provide a durable reverse lookup from an arbitrary source commit
  to its intent and workflow.

### Governed feedback loops

- [#616](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/616) implements one
  bounded Build & Test to Code Generation return path for
  [#611](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/611). It is an
  incremental loop, not a general cyclic graph engine.
- General cross-stage backward edges still need engine-level governance, stale
  artefact handling and explicit human authorization.

### Plugins and marketplace

- The plugin mechanism, content projection, selection and plugin-contributed
  scopes are shipped; the plugin test kit and authoring tiers shipped in
  [#792](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/792).
- The offline plugin CREATE, VALIDATE, BUILD, and TEST authoring tiers ship as
  the standalone `aidlc-plugin-create.ts`, `aidlc-plugin-validate.ts`,
  `aidlc-plugin-build.ts`, and `aidlc-plugin-test.ts` tools. The top-level
  command routes remain proposed in
  [#723](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/723).
  Remote discovery, trust, a first-party marketplace and a graduation path are
  also proposed in #723.
  Product discovery
  ([#652](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/652),
  [#782](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/782)) and design
  ([#527](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/527)) are candidates
  for first-party plugins.
- Plugin-native diagnostics are active in
  [#797](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/797); external authors
  can exercise composition against a disposable copy of an install with
  `aidlc-plugin-test.ts`.

### Knowledge and documents

- [#731](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/731) shipped
  DocumentKB's first indexing and citation slice;
  [#714](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/714) remains the
  broader retrieval lifecycle.
- [#694](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/694) proposes auditable
  supplemental-knowledge selection and delivery across stage topologies.

### Product discovery

- Core Ideation delivery remains under review in
  [#526](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/526), with an
  external-handover contract in
  [#586](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/586) and a
  plugin-shaped alternative in
  [#652](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/652).
- The delivery surface, core versus first-party plugin, is not yet settled.

### Installation, upgrades and releases

- [#722](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/722) covers binary
  packaging, installers, release automation, rollback and post-install setup;
  its milestones 1-3 implementation is under review in
  [#756](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/756). The earlier Bun
  dependency tracker [#399](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/399)
  is closed as superseded by #722.
- [#636](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/636) tracks a
  first-class upgrade contract. The earlier implementation PR
  [#535](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/535) closed without
  merging.
- [#635](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/635) tracks the
  mismatch between the v2 GA announcement and GitHub's Latest release still
  pointing at `v1.0.1`.

### Harness expansion and parity

- GitHub Copilot support shipped in
  [#657](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/657), and its RFC
  [#472](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/472) is closed.
- Cursor support shipped in
  [#661](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/661). A unified Kiro
  distribution is under review in
  [#775](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/775); the existing
  `dist/kiro-ide/` compatibility gap remains tracked separately in
  [#555](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/555), while matcher
  and adapter reliability continues in
  [#788](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/788).
- Antigravity setup is proposed in
  [#690](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/690).

### Evaluation and operations

- [#684](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/684) proposes
  repeatable benchmarks for measuring AI-DLC outcomes. Evaluator work is active
  in [#753](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/753); the earlier
  harness-evaluation tracker
  [#223](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/223) closed as not
  planned for v1.
- Operations-phase steering remains a requested direction
  ([#221](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/221),
  [#473](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/473)), not an active
  v2 implementation stream.

## Known gaps

- Stage-specific rules (`aidlc-stage-<slug>.md`) are reserved but unbuilt.
- Plugin `when:` evaluation, remote discovery and marketplace trust remain open.
- Sensor failures are advisory; blocking severity remains open in #431.
- General cross-stage cycles and progressive in-place artefact enrichment remain
  North Star gaps.
- Kiro's remaining gaps include the legacy `dist/kiro-ide/` compatibility issue
  (#555), plus hook registration/payload drift, plugin projection and argument
  forwarding (#763, #764, #776, #778, #779, #783, #784). The unified Kiro work
  in #775 is a separate distribution and does not yet retire that legacy gap.
- Several older community PRs remain open and need rebasing or disposition:
  #526 and #553. PRs #432, #535, #552, #653 and #712 closed without merging.
