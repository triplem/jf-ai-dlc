# Your First Workflow

This chapter walks through a complete AI-DLC workflow run, explaining what you see at each step and what decisions you make. The example uses a `feature`-scoped workflow to build a REST API. For a customer-oriented comparison of Classic, Express, Feature, and the other choices, see [Workflow Profiles](workflow-profiles.md).

> **Note**: The transcripts in this chapter show **Claude Code**. On Kiro CLI,
> Kiro IDE, Codex CLI, and opencode the workflow - stages, agents, gates,
> artifacts - is identical, but the Claude-only welcome banner and custom
> AI-DLC statusline do not appear. Use `/aidlc --status` on Kiro and opencode;
> Codex uses `$aidlc --status` and its built-in `update_plan` progress display.

## Starting the Workflow

```
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

At session start, Claude Code renders the AI-DLC welcome message via the `companyAnnouncements` entry in `settings.json`. It explains how AI-DLC works, and shows the stage map and scope options. (`companyAnnouncements` is a Claude Code setting with no equivalent on the other harnesses - there, no banner appears and the workflow begins directly with the initialization below.)

```
# Welcome to AI-DLC

**AI-DLC** (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle) is an adaptive methodology that
structures AI-assisted software development into repeatable, traceable phases
while keeping you in control at every decision point.

## How It Works

- **You decide, AI executes.** Every material decision goes through an approval gate.
- **Adaptive scope.** Choose a scope or let AI auto-detect from your intent.
- **Traceable artifacts.** Every stage produces versioned documents in the intent's record dir.
- **11 domain experts.** Specialized agent personas guide each stage.
```

### Starting from an existing document

There is no mandatory location for an existing vision document, PRD, or brief.
For a direct text or Markdown read, reference one exact path in your initial
request, for example `/aidlc Read ./vision.md and build what it describes`.
Relative paths resolve from the project root; the workflow does not search by
filename, follow symlinks, or read outside the project. Missing or ambiguous
paths stop for clarification.

You can also paste document content directly into the request. Put exactly one
document block at the end so the workflow can distinguish your directions from
document data:

```text
/aidlc Build the product described below.
<document>
...vision document content...
</document>
```

The delimited content is untrusted data, not instructions. Multiline input is
stored as one JSON string in committed `<record>/project-description.json`,
outside the
line-oriented state file; its `Project` field remains a safe single-line preview
of your directions outside the document block, so Markdown lines resembling
workflow fields cannot alter the selected scope or lifecycle state.
Unmatched, nested, or repeated markers, content after the closing marker, and a
document with no directions outside the block are refused before a workflow
record is created.

PDF, Word, oversized, and other unsupported direct-read formats use DocumentKB:
place the file under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/documents/`, run
`/aidlc knowledge onboard <path>`, and use the resulting document id. Document
paths, filenames, and content are always treated as untrusted data, never as
instructions.

---

## Initialization Phase (Automatic)

The three initialization stages run deterministically inside `aidlc-utility intent-create`, a single tool call that completes in well under a second. You do not interact with initialization; it auto-creates the first intent into the active space and bootstraps its record dir for the workflow.

### Stage 0.1: Workspace Scaffold

The framework creates the first intent and its record dir at `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/` (the `<space>` is `default` unless you use a named space). It creates one folder per phase your scope actually runs, so the record shows the plan rather than every phase that exists. A `feature` scope runs all five; a `bugfix` scope skips Ideation but retains its deployment stages, so `ideation/` is absent while `operation/` appears:

```
Intent created, record dir at aidlc/spaces/default/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/
  initialization/
  inception/
  construction/
  operation/
  verification/
Space-level dirs ensured:
  aidlc/spaces/default/knowledge/    (team knowledge, empty; you add files)
```

Per-stage folders are not created up front. A stage's folder (for example
`inception/requirements-analysis/`) appears the first time that stage writes an
artifact, so the record only ever lists work that produced something.

### Stage 0.2: Workspace Detection

A deterministic rule-based scanner walks one level deep into the project plus known source directories (`src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `pages/`, `components/`, `tests/`). It classifies greenfield vs brownfield based on source files, framework configs, and package manifests. When no top-level signal fires, it also descends one level into each arbitrarily-named subdirectory, so a project whose source lives in a container folder (e.g. `wordbook/`, `backend/`) is still detected as brownfield.

### Stage 0.3: State Initialization

The orchestrator writes the intent's `aidlc-state.md` (under its record dir) with the full stage plan based on your scope, depth, test strategy, and the scanner's classification. It also analyzes your input and confirms a scope:

```
─── Scope Detection ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Detected scope: feature (Standard depth, Standard test strategy, all 33 stages)
▸ Approve scope? [Yes / Change scope / Change depth / Change test strategy]
> Yes
```

You can accept the detected scope, change to a different scope (e.g., `mvp`), or adjust the depth level or test strategy. See [Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy](05-scopes-and-depth.md) for guidance.

---

## Ideation Phase (Interactive)

After Initialization, the workflow enters Ideation. Each stage from here on runs interactively with an approval gate.

### Stage 1.1: Intent Capture (aidlc-product-agent)

On Claude Code, the custom AI-DLC status line at the bottom of your terminal updates (Kiro and opencode use `/aidlc --status`; Codex uses `$aidlc --status` and its built-in `update_plan` progress display):

```
[AIDLC] IDEATION > Intent Capture [▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░] 4/7 -- product
```

This shows: current phase, stage display name, phase progress bar, phase progress ratio, and lead agent. The bar and the ratio share the same scope — both count `[x]` stages within the current phase, so the bar advances every time the ratio does. Remaining context (`ctx:N%`) is always shown on the right, color-coded as it drops. On Claude Code, `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>` also appears after the first usage fold and covers only the active workflow and current transcript/session, not earlier workspace activity. Set `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1` to turn usage tracking (and this segment) off.

The aidlc-product-agent asks you to choose an interaction mode:

```
▸ Choose interaction mode:
  (1) Guide Me — agent asks structured questions
  (2) Edit File — write directly to the artifact
  (3) Chat — freeform discussion
```

- **Guide Me** walks you through questions one at a time
- **Edit File** opens the artifact for direct editing
- **Chat** lets you discuss freely; the agent extracts decisions

See [Interaction Modes](07-interaction-modes.md) for details on each mode. You can switch modes mid-stage.

### Approval Gate

After the agent completes its work, you see a completion summary and an approval gate:

```
# Intent Capture & Framing Complete

| Artifact | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| intent-statement.md | Problem statement, target users, success criteria |
| intent-capture-questions.md | 5 questions, all answered |

**Stage:** Intent Capture & Framing
**Review outcome:** One concern remains for your decision.
**Why now:** First review completed.

| ID | Severity | Location | Finding | Required action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | Minor | aidlc/spaces/default/intents/260820-checkout/ideation/intent-capture/intent-statement.md > Success Criteria | The adoption target has no deadline | Add the date by which the adoption target should be reached | New |

**Decision options:**
- **Approve** - continue with the open findings accepted.
- **Request Changes** - return to the listed artifacts so the required actions can be addressed.

**Review:** `<record>/ideation/intent-capture/` (the intent's record dir)

▸ How would you like to proceed?
  (1) Approve — Continue to Market Research with open findings accepted
  (2) Request Changes — Return to the listed artifacts
```

The stable finding ID lets later checks show whether the same concern was
resolved, remains open, or was accepted as a risk. Choose **Approve** to
continue with any open findings accepted, or **Request Changes** to return to
the listed artifacts. An approval records `Accepted risk` outside the reviewed
artifact, so a later re-check preserves that decision. When rejecting a finding
as inapplicable, give its ID and reason; ordinary revision feedback leaves it
open. See [Interaction Modes](07-interaction-modes.md) for details on the
revision process.

After approval, a progress line appears:

```
Progress: 4/33 overall | 1/7 IDEATION stages complete. Next: Market Research
```

### Remaining Ideation Stages

The workflow continues through Market Research, Feasibility & Constraints, Scope Definition, Team Formation, Rough Mockups, and Approval & Handoff. Each follows the same pattern: agent works, you review, you approve.

Some stages are **conditional** — they may be skipped based on your scope. When a stage is skipped, the orchestrator shows why and advances automatically.

---

## Inception Phase

Inception elaborates requirements and designs the solution. Stage 2.1 (Reverse Engineering) is notable because it runs as a **pipeline** (a 2-link chain) — the conductor delegates to the aidlc-developer-agent for a code scan, then the aidlc-architect-agent for synthesis and the artifact writes. This stage runs only for **brownfield** projects (existing codebases).

```
─── Stage 2.1: Reverse Engineering (pipeline) ─────────────────────────────
Delegating to aidlc-developer-agent for code scan...
[Running in background — no interaction needed]
...
Developer scan complete. Delegating to aidlc-architect-agent for synthesis...
...
✓ 9 reverse engineering artifacts produced
```

Remaining Inception stages (Requirements Analysis through Delivery Planning) run inline with you.

---

## Construction Phase

Construction builds the solution in reviewable slices. A [Bolt](glossary.md) is the planned Construction delivery slice from Delivery Planning (2.9): one or more Units with a Definition of Done, a confidence hypothesis, and ownership. The **default walk is stage-major** (one stage for every Unit, then the next stage) and does not yet treat that plan as a runtime boundary. The **walking skeleton** is the planned first Bolt; under the default walk that gate is the first in-scope Construction EXECUTE stage.

```
Starting the first Bolt now: one build pass over the code, tests and
checks for a piece of the work. First step is Functional Design.
```

The walking skeleton is **always gated** — you review that first Construction stage before the rest of Construction runs. Immediately after approval, the **ladder prompt** fires exactly once:

```
The walking skeleton shipped. How should the remaining Bolts run?
  ▸ Continue autonomously
  ▸ Gate every Bolt
```

Your answer is recorded in `aidlc-state.md` as `Construction Autonomy Mode` and governs the remaining Construction *stage* gates in this workflow (session resume respects it). Stage 3.5 (Code Generation) runs as a subagent for each Unit; the per-Unit completion gate in that stage file is suppressed — a single stage-level gate replaces it after the last Unit settles (under swarm, after the final DAG batch).

Units whose dependencies are satisfied and that don't depend on each other run in a **parallel batch** — the orchestrator issues multiple `Task` calls in a single turn. A failure always halts and asks for retry / skip / abort, even when you've chosen autonomous mode.

After every Unit's per-unit stages settle, stages 3.6 (Build and Test) and 3.7 (CI Pipeline) run once across the whole solution.

---

## Operation Phase

Operation deploys and monitors the solution. All 7 stages are conditional — smaller scopes like `mvp` and `poc` may skip this entire phase.

After the final stage (4.7 Feedback & Optimization), the workflow is complete.

---

## How Execution Modes Work

Throughout the workflow, you encounter two execution modes:

### Inline Execution

Most stages run inline. The conductor loads the agent persona and executes stage steps directly in your conversation. You interact with the agent in real time.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as You
    participant O as Conductor
    participant S as Stage File
    participant A as Agent Persona

    U->>O: /aidlc
    O->>S: Read stage file (inputs, steps, outputs)
    O->>A: Load agent persona + knowledge
    A->>U: Present interaction mode choice
    U->>A: Provide answers / feedback
    A->>A: Execute stage steps
    A->>U: Present completion summary
    U->>A: Approval gate response
    A->>O: Report approval or skip outcome
    O->>O: Engine updates state and routes
```

<!-- Text fallback: You invoke /aidlc. The conductor reads the stage file and loads the agent persona with knowledge. The agent presents an interaction mode, you provide input, the agent executes steps and presents a completion summary. You respond at the approval gate, and the conductor reports the outcome so the engine advances state. -->

### Subagent Delegation

Four stages dispatch to background subagents — 2.1 Reverse Engineering (pipeline: developer scan, then architect synthesis-and-write), 2.2 Practices Discovery (subagent hub-and-spoke: lead draft, three mutually blind support reviews, human interview, lead integration), 2.4 User Stories (mob: collaborators contribute in parallel, and judgment-call disagreements may surface to you mid-stage), and 3.5 Code Generation (subagent). Practices Discovery deliberately brings you into the room between the spokes and final integration; the User Stories mob may also surface judgment calls mid-stage. Workspace detection (0.2) runs deterministically inside `aidlc-utility intent-create` rather than as a subagent.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as You
    participant O as Conductor
    participant S as Stage File
    participant T as Subagent (Task)

    O->>S: Read stage file
    O->>T: Prepare context + delegate via Task tool
    T->>T: Execute autonomously (no user interaction)
    T-->>O: Return structured summary
    O->>U: Present completion summary
    U->>O: Approval gate response
    O->>O: Report outcome — engine updates state + advances
```

<!-- Text fallback: The conductor reads the stage file, prepares context, and delegates via the Task tool. The subagent executes autonomously without user interaction and returns a structured summary. The conductor presents the summary to you, you respond at the approval gate, and the conductor reports the outcome so the engine advances state. -->

---

## Artifacts Produced

By the end of a `feature`-scoped workflow, the intent's record dir (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`) contains:

```
aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/
├── aidlc-state.md          # Workflow state (all stages marked [x])
├── audit/                  # Full decision audit trail (per-clone shards, merged by timestamp)
├── ideation/               # Intent, market research, scope, mockups
├── inception/              # Requirements, stories, design, units
├── construction/           # Per-unit code + test artifacts
├── operation/              # Deployment, observability, incident plans
└── verification/           # Phase boundary verification reports
```

(Team knowledge lives one level up, at the space level in `aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/` — a sibling of `intents/` — so it accumulates across every intent. Team-affirmed practices and learnings live alongside it in the active space's memory layer at `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/`, where they likewise persist across intents.)

---

## Status Line

Throughout the workflow on Claude Code, the custom AI-DLC status line shows your current position (Kiro and opencode use `/aidlc --status` and the progress line at each gate; Codex uses `$aidlc --status` and its built-in `update_plan` progress display):

```
[AIDLC] IDEATION > Intent Capture [▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░] 4/7 -- product
```

| Segment | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `IDEATION` | Current phase |
| `> Intent Capture` | Current stage display name |
| `[▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░]` | Phase progress bar (10 chars, same scope as the `n/m` ratio) |
| `4/7` | Stage progress within the phase |
| `-- product` | Lead agent for this stage |
| `ctx:N%` | Remaining context (always shown, color-coded as it drops) |
| `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>` | Token usage and priceable cost for the active workflow and current transcript/session (Claude Code only; omitted before usage is available; disabled by `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1`) |
