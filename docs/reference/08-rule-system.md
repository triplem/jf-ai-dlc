# Rule System

> Audience: Tier 2/3 (team adopter, framework contributor).

This chapter is the schema-level reference for the v0.5.0 rule system: where rule files live, how scope is derived, how the inheritance chain resolves, and which frontmatter fields are valid. It is the spec the resolver (`aidlc-graph.ts compile`) and the doctor rule-drift check read against. Rules are the feedforward half of the control loop; [Sensor System](07-sensor-system.md) covers the deterministic-verification half they pair with. For the user-facing walkthrough — the learning-loop ritual, the ANZ worked example, and how a confirmed learning lands in a rule file — see [Rules and the Learning Loop](../guide/09-rules-and-the-learning-loop.md) in the User Guide.

## Layout

Rules live in the active space memory layer at `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/` (one hand-editable set at the workspace root, read by every harness via its native include — Claude `@`-import stub, Kiro CLI agent resources, Kiro IDE always-included steering with live file references, Codex `AIDLC_RULES_DIR`) with neutral scope-named files:

```
aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/
├── org.md
├── team.md
├── project.md
└── phases/
    ├── ideation.md
    ├── inception.md
    ├── construction.md
    └── operation.md
```

The layout consolidates team-authored harness config (formerly in a separate practices namespace) and self-learning guardrails (formerly two-deep) into a single active space memory directory at `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/`.

## Filename-derived scope

Rule files do **not** carry a `scope:` frontmatter field. Scope is derived from the filename:

| Filename pattern | Scope |
|---|---|
| `org.md` | `org` |
| `team.md` | `team` |
| `project.md` | `project` |
| `phases/<phase>.md` | `phase` (phase value = filename) |

Org, team, project, and phase rules carry no path-scoping frontmatter — pull authoring puts the relationship on the stage side. Org / team / project apply to every stage as universal defaults (filename-derived); the matching phase rule attaches because the stage's frontmatter `phase: <name>` field is the pull import for `phases/<name>.md`.

## Five-layer inheritance

Rules resolve through a five-layer chain at workflow start:

```
org → team → project → phase → stage
```

Org carries framework defaults; team and project layers extend with team-affirmed and project-specialised content. Phase is orthogonal — it attaches the matching `phases/<name>.md` rule because the stage already declared `phase: <name>` in its frontmatter (the same authoring direction as `requires_stage` and `consumes`). Stage rules are reserved-for-future-use; when authored, each `aidlc-stage-<slug>.md` will attach via the stage's `slug:` declaration. Cross-link to [01-architecture.md § Configuration layers](01-architecture.md) for the broader two-axis configuration model this chain operationalises.

The compile output (`stage-graph.json` per-stage `rules_in_context` field) bakes the resolved chain into each stage node. Runtime never walks the chain — the compile owns resolution.

## Strict-additive runtime model

Every applicable rule appears in `rules_in_context`. Org, team, and project rules concatenate; nothing drops at runtime. The phase rule attaches when the rule's filename matches the stage's `phase:` declaration - no glob filter, no concrete-path synthesis. Before `run-stage`, the engine reads each substantive rule file from the active space and emits its text through one or more bounded `load-steering` directives. Continuation tokens carry an integrity MAC keyed by a random, machine-local secret under the active intent's gitignored `.aidlc-*` runtime state, or under the clone-local session runtime before an intent exists; the token binds the stage, workflow state, rule bundle, route, and next part and cannot be re-signed from the public project path. A fresh `next` lazily mints the key when needed. There is no size-based path fallback. Empty templates are dropped, while unreadable or invalid required rules stop with repair guidance. Delivery repeats every stage, so a learning admitted mid-workflow reaches the next stage.

The §13 Learnings Ritual asks the orchestrator to screen for conflicts (a narrower scope contradicting broader policy) at the memory gate before a learning reaches the resolver. The check is section-level: when a proposed dated learning entry is about to be written to `memory/project.md` (or `memory/team.md`), the orchestrator compares it against `memory/org.md`'s matching heading via an LLM check; if a conflict is found, the user **revises, skips, or escalates** (there is no override path). Only conflict-clear or user-escalated selections reach `aidlc-learnings.ts persist`, which does not read `org.md` or independently judge the comparison. The check is therefore an audit aid, not a deterministic enforcement boundary. Practices-discovery's affirmation gate is the other admission gate, but its promotion is a deterministic section-replace (`aidlc-state.ts practices-promote`) legitimised by the user's affirmation — it does not run the automated org-conflict check. Post-write drift between org and team/project content is surfaced separately by the doctor's rule-drift row (below).

This design replaces the earlier `enforcement: enforced` keyword and `overrides:` block model. Both keywords are removed from the schema. Frontmatter parsing rejects them via the unknown-key tolerance policy below — they pass through silently rather than throwing, but the resolver ignores them.

The doctor rule-drift check surfaces post-write drift on demand: when org rules change after team or project content has already landed on disk, doctor deterministically finds `##` headings that the team/project practice files (`memory/team.md`, `memory/project.md`) share with a *populated* org heading and surfaces each overlap as an advisory candidate — file, section, and the quoted org sentence — rendered `Rule drift: N team/project rule(s) overlap org policy (review for contradiction)`. Overlaps from a stale file are removed from that live count and reported separately as `Rule drift: N stale-suppressed`. Doctor itself runs no LLM: detection is byte-reproducible heading/string work. The contradiction verdict — the same section-level LLM check the admission gates run — is the consuming orchestrator's at observation-time, non-blocking. The human then revises, escalates, or accepts the surfaced drift.

## `pairing:` field

Rules MAY pair with a deterministic sensor from `.claude/sensors/aidlc-*.md`:

```yaml
---
pairing: aidlc-required-sections
---
# or
pairing: feedforward-only
---
```

Valid values:

- `feedforward-only` — explicit declaration that the rule has no sensor companion (the framework cannot verify it deterministically).
- `<sensor-id>` — must match an existing `.claude/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md` `id:` field.

The doctor paired-coverage row counts paired-vs-feedforward-only rules and surfaces unpaired rules as a coverage gap (see [Rule-drift detection](#rule-drift-detection)).

## Lifecycle fields

Every rule file MAY declare file-level lifecycle metadata:

```yaml
---
status: active
stale_after: 2026-12-31
---
```

- `status` accepts exactly `active`, `deprecated`, or `draft`. `deprecated` makes the file stale; `active` and `draft` do not.
- `stale_after` must be a real calendar date in `YYYY-MM-DD` form. A file becomes stale only when the current UTC date is strictly greater than that value, so the `stale_after` day itself remains live.
- Lifecycle applies to the whole file, not individual headings. A stale team/project file's org-heading overlaps move from the live rule-drift count into the separate passing `stale-suppressed` row.

Both fields are optional, and invalid values stop rule loading with an error that names the file. They are valid on org, team, project, and phase rule files, although the Tier-1 deterministic consumer is deliberately limited to suppressing team/project overlaps in `/aidlc --doctor`; lifecycle metadata does not remove any rule from the strict-additive runtime bundle.

## Rule-drift detection

`/aidlc --doctor` ships two advisory rows that observe rule/sensor state. Both are read-only and always pass — neither changes the health-check exit code. (As of v0.6.10 `--doctor` is cold-safe: the `GUARDRAIL_LOADED` audit row the paired-coverage check emits is written only when the active intent's `audit/` shard already exists. On a fresh shell with no intent yet, doctor prints the rows but emits nothing and creates no files.)

- **Rule drift** — for each team/project practice file (`memory/team.md`, `memory/project.md`), doctor finds `##` headings that also appear under a *populated* heading in `memory/org.md` and surfaces each overlap as a candidate pair: file, section, and the first org sentence quoted verbatim. Headings whose org body is empty (e.g. the framework-default `## Forbidden`, `## Mandated`, `## Corrections`, which hold only HTML comments) do not count — the overlap must carry content on both sides. Live overlaps render in the existing review-for-contradiction row; overlaps from files whose lifecycle is stale render in one separate `Rule drift: N stale-suppressed` advisory row with the same inline detail. The count N in each row is the number of *structural* candidate pairs, not LLM-confirmed contradictions: doctor detects deterministically; the contradiction verdict is the orchestrator-LLM's at observation time (see the [strict-additive section](#strict-additive-runtime-model)).
- **Paired sensor coverage** — for each rule carrying `pairing: <sensor-id>`, doctor strips the `aidlc-` prefix and confirms the named sensor exists in at least one stage's resolved sensor set (`sensors_applicable`). The row reads `Paired sensor coverage: P/(M-X) guardrails paired (X feedforward-only)`, where M is the rules carrying a `pairing:` value, X is the feedforward-only rules (which never need a sensor), and P is the rules whose named sensor resolves; unpaired rules (sensor id named but bound by no stage) are listed inline. This is a **file-existence check, not a semantic one** — it confirms the binding resolves, not that the sensor fits the rule. The row emits the `GUARDRAIL_LOADED` audit event once per run on an initialized project (the emit is suppressed on a pristine project with no `audit.md` — see the cold-safe note above).

## Forward-compat policy

Rule frontmatter is forward-compatible by additive extension:

- New fields land as additive — existing rule lines never need rewriting.
- Consumers MUST tolerate unknown frontmatter keys (ignore + pass through). This is how legacy `enforcement:` / `overrides:` keys (if present in user-extension overlays) load without error.
- Rule body conventions (sections like `## Forbidden`, `## Mandated`) follow the existing guardrail conventions.
- The Learnings Ritual (the memory gate) writes each confirmed learning as a practice directly into the space memory files — `memory/project.md` (default) and `memory/team.md` (one-click promote; no org-scope write) — as a dated entry under its diary-heading topic. A confirmed learning *is* a practice: these are the same files practices-discovery affirms, not a separate `*-learnings.md` surface. The resolver sorts them on the clean integer chain `SCOPE_PRIORITY` (org:0, team:1, project:2, phase:3) — there are no fractional 1.5 / 2.5 tiers. The orchestrator performs the admission conflict-check described under `## Strict-additive runtime model` above (single proposed dated entry vs `memory/org.md`'s matching section; revise / skip / escalate, no override path), then `aidlc-learnings.ts persist` writes the selections it receives without re-running that comparison.

Pre-v0.5.0 rule files load unchanged after the rename + flatten lands; migration is path-only.

  workflow start and read off the graph node throughout the workflow.
