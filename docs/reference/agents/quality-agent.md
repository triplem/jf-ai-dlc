## Knowledge Sources

### Methodology (Tier 1)

Path: `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-quality-agent/`

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| nfr-reliability-guide.md | Reliability testing methodology and resilience validation |
| nfr-validation-methods.md | NFR validation techniques (load testing, performance profiling) |
| test-strategy-patterns.md | Test pyramid patterns, test data strategies, quality gate design |

### Team (Tier 2)

Path: `aidlc/knowledge/aidlc-quality-agent/` (the space-level knowledge dir; user-managed)

A space-level directory the team creates when it has content (the engine ships `aidlc/knowledge/` empty). Populated by the team with project-specific
QA context such as existing test frameworks, coverage targets, performance
baselines, or quality gate thresholds.
