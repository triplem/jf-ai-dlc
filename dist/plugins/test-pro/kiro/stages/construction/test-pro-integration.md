# Cross-Unit Integration Testing

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

Unlike `build-and-test`, which runs per the unit boundary, this stage runs ONCE
after all units are built — so it can test that the units COMPOSE. It exercises
the cross-unit seams the per-unit tests structurally cannot see.

## Steps

### Step 1: Read All Per-Unit Outputs

Read every unit's code summary and build-and-test output from the per-unit
construction record dirs and the cross-unit `build-and-test-summary`. Build
the cross-unit view: which units call which, the shared contracts, the data that
crosses unit boundaries.

### Step 2: Identify Cross-Unit Seams

Enumerate the integration points — API calls between units, shared data
contracts, event/message boundaries, shared state. Produce
`test-pro-cross-unit-contract-matrix.md` mapping each seam to the contract it
must honor.

### Step 3: Generate the Integration Test Plan

Write `test-pro-integration-test-plan.md`: for each seam, the integration tests
(happy path + contract violation + failure propagation across the boundary).

### Step 4: Execute Integration Tests

Run the integration tests against the assembled units. Capture results into
`test-pro-integration-test-results.md` (total / passed / failed, with the seam
each failure touches).

### Step 5: Open the Approval Gate

Run `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage test-pro-integration --result awaiting-approval`.

### Step 6: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :link:
Review path: this stage's engine-resolved record dir.
Standard 2-option approval (Approve / Request Changes).
STOP for the human response. Report Approve with
`--result approved --user-input "<exact choice>"`; report
Request Changes with `--result rejected --user-input "<feedback>"`, revise the
artifacts, then report `--result revised` before re-presenting.

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under its record dir. The imported `required-sections` and `upstream-coverage` sensors check those outputs.

## Learn

While running this stage, record observations in the engine-created
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`. Treat it as an output-only target:
never read, probe, create, or initialize it. Follow the active harness's
diary-write discipline when inserting entries under Interpretations,
Deviations, Tradeoffs, and Open questions, each with an ISO 8601 timestamp.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file.
