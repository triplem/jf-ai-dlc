# Full Test Suite Execution

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

Runs the full regression + edge + API positive/negative suite against the
DEPLOYED environment — the end-to-end confirmation that the assembled, deployed
system behaves, beyond the per-unit construction tests.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

Read the deployed-environment coordinates from `deployment-log`, the regression
suite (`test-pro-regression-suite`), and the cross-unit integration results.

### Step 2: Execute the Full Suite

Run the regression suite, the edge/boundary tests, and the API positive+negative
tests against the deployed environment. Capture pass/fail per category.

### Step 3: Generate Reports

Write `test-pro-full-suite-results.md` (regression results, per-category
summary) and `test-pro-edge-api-report.md` (edge + API positive/negative detail,
with any failures and the requirement each touches).

### Step 4: Open the Approval Gate

Run `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage test-pro-full-suite --result awaiting-approval`.

### Step 5: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :test_tube:
Review path: this stage's engine-resolved record dir.
Standard 2-option approval (Approve / Request Changes).
STOP for the human response. Report Approve with
`--result approved --user-input "<exact choice>"`; report
Request Changes with `--result rejected --user-input "<feedback>"`, revise the
artifacts, then report `--result revised` before re-presenting.

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under its record dir. The imported `required-sections` and `upstream-coverage` sensors check those outputs.

## Learn

While running this stage, record observations in the engine-created
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`. Treat it as an output-only target:
never read, probe, create, or initialize it. Follow the active harness's
diary-write discipline when inserting entries under Interpretations,
Deviations, Tradeoffs, and Open questions, each with an ISO 8601 timestamp.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file.
