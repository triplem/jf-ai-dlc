// harness/kiro/manifest.ts — the Kiro CLI distribution row.
//
// Projects the harness-neutral core/ tree into dist/kiro/.kiro/, plus Kiro's
// authored shell surfaces (orchestrator skill, agent JSON configs, the stdin
// adapter hook, settings/cli.json, AGENTS.md). Mirrors the proven
// package-kiro.ts spike, generalized onto the unified packager.
//
// Kiro specifics vs Claude:
//   - token → .kiro
//   - rules/ → steering/ (Kiro auto-loads steering; rules ARE the always-on
//     layer)
//   - the orchestrator skill is per-harness (authored here, NOT core), so it
//     is NOT in coreDirs — only the 3 session skills are.
//   - agents/ is MIXED: the persona .md files are core (copied + rules rename
//     n/a), the Kiro-native agent .json configs are authored (harnessFiles).
//   - hooks/ is MIXED: core hook bodies are copied; the one authored
//     aidlc-kiro-adapter.ts stdin shim is a harnessFile.
//   - AGENTS.md lands at the PROJECT ROOT (dist/kiro/AGENTS.md), outside .kiro/.
