# Inception Phase -- Stage Reference (2.1--2.9)

## Phase Overview

The Inception phase is the third of five phases in the AI-DLC methodology. It
transforms the Ideation phase's business intent and scope into concrete
technical artifacts: reverse-engineered codebase understanding (for brownfield
projects), team practices and operational rules, formal requirements, user
stories, refined mockups, application architecture, unit-of-work decomposition,
and a delivery plan that governs the Construction phase.

Inception runs stages 2.1 through 2.9 (9 stages) and concludes with a phase
boundary verification check at Stage 2.9 (Delivery Planning) before handing
off to Construction.

> **Path convention.** Each workflow's artifacts live under its **intent record
> dir** — `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/` (where `<space>` is
> `default` unless a non-default space is in play, `<YYMMDD>` is a compact UTC
> date prefix so records sort chronologically, and `<label>` is a short
> kebab-case essence of the request; same-day collisions get a numeric counter).
> The canonical, collision-proof id is the UUIDv7 recorded in the `intents.json`
> registry row — the dir name is just a human-readable label. Below, `<record>/`
> is shorthand for that dir; e.g.
> `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md` expands to
> `aidlc/spaces/default/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`.
> Reverse Engineering outputs are the exception: they live outside the intent
> record in the durable, per-repository store
> `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`.
> (Projects created before the per-intent layout used a flat tree; the engine
> migrates them on first run.)

The phase contains three dispatched topologies: the two-link Reverse
Engineering pipeline at Stage 2.1, the Practices Discovery hub-and-spoke at
Stage 2.2, and the User Stories mob at Stage 2.4.

**Key characteristics of the Inception phase:**

- The phase begins with a technical discovery stage (2.1 Reverse Engineering)
  that uses a two-link pipeline, followed by a methodology-discovery stage
  (2.2 Practices Discovery) that uses a subagent hub-and-spoke, then an inline
  requirements stage, a mob story stage, and five inline design/planning stages.
- Stage 2.1 uses a two-link pipeline: aidlc-developer-agent scans the code,
  then aidlc-architect-agent synthesizes the scan into 9 structured artifacts. It
  checks each brownfield repository's existing store before the human chooses
  reuse, a replacing full rescan, or a focused scan that cumulatively merges
  knowledge into the shared store.
- Stage 2.2 runs the same topology on greenfield and brownfield work:
  pipeline-deploy lead draft, mutually blind quality/developer/devsecops
  spokes, human interview, then lead integration. On affirmation, content is promoted from
  `<record>/inception/practices-discovery/` to the space's memory layer —
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/team.md` and `project.md` —
  the cross-row promotion that makes this stage structurally distinct from every other stage.
- Stage 2.7 produces `unit-of-work.md`, which defines the units that drive
  the phased construction flow in the Construction phase.
- Stage 2.9 produces the approved Bolt plan (economic sequence, multi-Unit
  grouping, DoD, confidence hypothesis, ownership). That plan is planning
  content; Construction's runtime batches come from
  `unit-of-work-dependency.md` (2.7). Stage 2.9 reads
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/{org,team,project}.md` for the team's Way
  of Working, Walking Skeleton stance, and Deployment sections.
- The phase boundary verification at Stage 2.9 validates Requirements to
  Stories to Architecture alignment.

### Purpose

Reverse Engineering performs a comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase
for brownfield projects. It runs as a two-link pipeline (`mode: pipeline`):
first, the aidlc-developer-agent scans the entire codebase; then, the aidlc-architect-agent
synthesizes the scan results into 9 structured artifacts and writes them. These artifacts
provide the technical foundation that all subsequent Inception and Construction
stages build upon.

**Rerun guard:** Reverse Engineering checks each repository's recorded scope
and working-tree fingerprint before scanning. The human may reuse a
verified-current store whose coverage fits the intent; stale, unverified,
legacy, or mismatched stores require a full or focused rescan. Full rescans
replace the store; focused rescans merge newly analyzed areas into it while
preserving prior prose. For multi-repo intents, all decisions are resolved
before one stage-level lifecycle report.

### Inputs

- `<record>/aidlc-state.md` (project type confirmation)

### Steps

1. **Check Conditions** -- Read `<record>/aidlc-state.md` to confirm the
   project type is brownfield. If the project is not brownfield, skip this
   stage with `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage reverse-engineering
   --result skipped --reason "greenfield workspace has no existing codebase to
   reverse engineer"`. The engine records `[S]` and routes onward atomically.

2. **Developer Code Scan** -- Delegate to Task tool with the aidlc-developer-agent
   subagent (`subagent_type="aidlc-developer-agent"`). Include aidlc-developer-agent persona from
   `agents/aidlc-developer-agent.md` and knowledge from
   `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-developer-agent/` in the delegation prompt.
   Include workspace state from `aidlc-state.md` as context.

   The developer scans the entire codebase for:
   - All packages, modules, and their purposes
   - Build systems, configuration, and dependency relationships
   - External and internal APIs (endpoints, contracts, methods)
   - Frameworks, libraries, and their versions
   - Test directories, test frameworks, coverage configuration
   - Code quality indicators (linting, CI/CD, documentation)
   - Technical debt signals

   Developer returns structured scan results following the Developer Code Scan
   Template in
   `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/aidlc-developer-agent/re-artifacts.md`.

3. **Architect Synthesis** -- Delegate to Task tool with the aidlc-architect-agent
   subagent (`subagent_type="aidlc-architect-agent"`). Include aidlc-architect-agent persona from
   `agents/aidlc-architect-agent.md` and knowledge from
   `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-architect-agent/` in the delegation prompt. Pass
   the complete developer scan results as context. Include workspace state from
   `aidlc-state.md`. Resolve the repository's output directory with
   `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts codekb-path --repo <repo>`.
   Immediately before the scan, capture source/store generations with
   `codekb-snapshot`. Pass the existing store plus its snapshot to the
   architect.

   The architect synthesizes scan results into the 9 output artifacts (see
   Outputs below) in a temporary complete candidate directory. The engine
   publishes that candidate with `codekb-publish`, which refuses a source
   change or concurrent shared-store generation and requires a fresh scan or
   re-merge before retrying.

4. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify all nine artifacts exist. Do not edit
   `aidlc-state.md`; lifecycle completion belongs to the report after the gate.

5. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Open the gate with
   `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage reverse-engineering --result
   awaiting-approval`, display all nine artifacts, then report the human's
   approved/rejected outcome through the same engine command.

### Outputs

All 9 artifacts for each repository are written to
`aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`, using the exact directory printed
by `aidlc-utility.ts codekb-path --repo <repo>`:

| #  | File                             | Contents                                                    |
|----|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | `business-overview.md`           | Business domain, purpose, key functionality                 |
| 2  | `architecture.md`                | System architecture, patterns, component relationships (with Mermaid diagrams). MUST include Interaction Diagrams section depicting how business transactions are implemented across components (sequence or flow diagrams). |
| 3  | `code-structure.md`              | Package/module organization, file classification, code patterns |
| 4  | `api-documentation.md`           | External and internal API surfaces, endpoints, contracts    |
| 5  | `component-inventory.md`         | Complete component list with responsibilities and dependencies |
| 6  | `technology-stack.md`            | Languages, frameworks, libraries with versions              |
| 7  | `dependencies.md`                | External dependencies, internal cross-package dependencies  |
| 8  | `code-quality-assessment.md`     | Test coverage, linting, CI/CD, documentation quality, tech debt |
| 9  | `reverse-engineering-timestamp.md` | When RE was performed (date, commit hash if available, scope of analysis) |

### Approval Gate

Standard 2-option gate: **Approve** (continue to Requirements Analysis) /
**Request Changes**.

### Notes

- **Rerun guard:** This stage verifies each brownfield repository's recorded
  scope and fingerprint before the human chooses reuse or rescan. It is a
  deliberate deviation from the upstream reference, documented in SKILL.md's
  "Deliberate Deviations" section.
- **Two-link pipeline:** The aidlc-developer-agent performs the raw code
  scan (link 1, the lead), then the aidlc-architect-agent synthesizes the scan
  into structured artifacts and writes them (link 2, the final link). This separation ensures the scan is thorough (developer
  perspective) and the synthesis is architecturally informed (architect
  perspective).
- For bugfix and refactor scopes, this stage always executes (even for what
  might be borderline greenfield) because understanding existing code is
  essential.
- For security-patch scope, this stage executes to find vulnerability context.
- The 9 artifacts produced here are consumed by Requirements Analysis (2.3),
  User Stories (2.4), Domain Design (2.6), and Units Generation (2.7).
- The `architecture.md` artifact must include Interaction Diagrams showing how
  business transactions are implemented across components, using sequence or
  flow diagrams.

| Completion Emoji | (uses stage-protocol.md completion template)                           |

### Purpose

Practices Discovery is the only stage in AI-DLC that writes to both rows of
the two-axis configuration model. It discovers a team's way of working,
walking-skeleton stance, testing posture, deployment cadence, and code-style
rules. Brownfield runs use repository and Reverse Engineering evidence;
greenfield runs seed the lead draft from active-space `org.md`. Both use the
same subagent hub-and-spoke: pipeline-deploy lead draft, mutually blind
quality/developer/devsecops contributions, human interview, then lead
integration. After the human approves at the affirmation gate, the content is
promoted into `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/team.md` and `project.md`
before the stage reports approval.

### Inputs

- `<record>/aidlc-state.md` (project type)
- Brownfield only: reverse-engineering's 9 artifacts from
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` (business-overview,
  architecture, code-structure, api-documentation, component-inventory,
  technology-stack, dependencies, code-quality-assessment,
  reverse-engineering-timestamp)
- `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/{org,team,project}.md` (defaults and prior affirmations)
- `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent/branching-strategies.md` (lead-agent KB)

### Outputs

Four lead artifacts plus three spoke contributions are written to
`<record>/inception/practices-discovery/`:

- `team-practices.md` -- descriptive, team-voice prose. Five sections matching
  `team.md` headings: Way of Working, Walking Skeleton, Testing Posture,
  Deployment, Code Style. Testing Posture carries structured
  `Methodology: tdd|bdd|atdd|test-after|custom` and `Ordering: ...` bullets;
  coverage/tooling/scope notes remain additional prose.
- `discovered-rules.md` -- corrective, agent-facing. Two sections: Mandated
  (`ALWAYS …` rules) and Forbidden (`NEVER …` rules).
- `evidence.md` -- per-agent finding summary; freshness trail for re-runs.
- `practices-discovery-timestamp.md` -- run timestamp + commit hash.
- `contributions/aidlc-{quality,developer,devsecops}-agent.md` -- one
  identity-marked contribution from each mutually blind spoke; these files are
  engine-checked completion evidence.

On affirmation, content is promoted to:

- `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/team.md` -- section-replace via `replaceSection` (re-runs
  overwrite section content rather than accumulate).
- `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/project.md` -- append-under-heading
  via `appendUnderHeading` (rules accumulate; date stamps distinguish them).

### Steps

1. **Classify Inputs** -- Read `aidlc-state.md` to classify greenfield vs
   brownfield and resolve the active space. Brownfield loads Reverse
   Engineering artifacts and repository evidence. Greenfield loads defaults
   from `memory/org.md`. A re-run also loads prior `team.md` and `project.md`.
2. **Lead Draft** -- Dispatch `aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent`. It writes the
   initial `team-practices.md`, `discovered-rules.md`, and `evidence.md`.
   Brownfield drafts from observed evidence; greenfield drafts from org
   defaults and clearly marks every unconfirmed assumption.
3. **Three Mutually Blind Spokes** -- In one parallel batch, dispatch
   `aidlc-quality-agent`, `aidlc-developer-agent`, and
   `aidlc-devsecops-agent` against the lead draft. Briefs contain the draft
   paths but no other spoke's output. Each writes its own identity-marked
   contribution file under `contributions/`; it does not edit the lead's
   artifacts.
4. **Human Interview** -- Present structured questions after all three spokes
   return. Brownfield asks evidence gaps and policy judgments; greenfield asks
   all five practice areas with org defaults as suggestions. Re-runs pre-fill
   prior affirmed statements. Log every question and exact answer.
5. **Lead Integration** -- Dispatch the pipeline-deploy lead again with the
   draft, all three contribution paths, and the interview answers. The lead
   alone integrates the final artifacts and emits `PRACTICES_DISCOVERED`.
   Mixed cadences use `Methodology: custom` so Code Generation preserves the
   explicit ordering rather than coercing the answer into TDD.
6. **Open the Affirmation Gate** -- Call `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage
   practices-discovery --result awaiting-approval` before asking. Present the
   drafts with exactly two options: **Approve** / **Request Changes**. A
   Request Changes response is reported through `--result rejected`; no
   promotion occurs.
7. **Promote After Human Approval** -- Only after the human chooses Approve,
   run the deterministic promotion into active-space `team.md` and
   `project.md`. It writes `project.md` first and `team.md` second and emits
   `PRACTICES_AFFIRMED`. If promotion fails, it emits `PRACTICES_OVERRIDE`,
   leaves the stage `[?]` with the gate open, and does not report approval.
8. **Verify Receipt, Then Report** -- Successful promotion atomically records
   `Practices Affirmed Timestamp` and the matching `PRACTICES_AFFIRMED` audit
   receipt. Then call
   `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage practices-discovery --result
   approved --user-input "Approve"`. The engine verifies all three
   contribution files and the current-attempt receipt before completing and
   routing.

### Approval Gate

Standard 2-option gate: **Approve** / **Request Changes**. Approve is held
open while promotion runs; only after promotion and the affirmed timestamp
succeed may the conductor report
`--result approved --user-input "<exact choice>"`. Promotion failure leaves the
gate open and the stage incomplete.

### Notes

- The `replaceSection` helper in `.claude/tools/aidlc-lib.ts` was added in milestone 8
  specifically to support the team.md cross-row promotion (the existing
  `appendUnderHeading` accumulates duplicates across re-runs).
- `org.md` and `team.md` share one Title Case heading set
  (`## Way of Working`, `## Walking Skeleton`, `## Testing Posture`,
  `## Deployment`, `## Code Style`). The stage reads each section from
  `org.md` via `extractMarkdownSection` with the matching Title Case
  heading and section-replaces the same heading in `team.md`.
- Code Generation's deterministic posture resolver reads the structured
  Testing Posture fields independently from coverage, tooling, and scope notes.
  A project-only coverage note therefore specializes the team section without
  erasing its methodology.
- On resume, keep the lead draft and every existing contribution file.
  Dispatch only missing spokes, then continue with the interview and lead
  integration. Do not repeat completed support work.
- Contribution evidence is mandatory. Approval is refused if any quality,
  developer, or devsecops contribution is missing or has the wrong identity
  marker.

Requirements Analysis transforms the user's intent and any reverse-engineered
codebase understanding into formal, structured requirements. It assesses the
request for clarity, type, scope, and complexity; determines the appropriate
depth; extracts what is already known; runs a completeness analysis across six
dimensions; generates clarifying questions; and produces a formal requirements
document.

This stage always executes but adapts its depth based on project complexity:
minimal for clear/narrow scope, standard for moderate scope, comprehensive for
large scope with significant unknowns.

### Inputs

- Reverse Engineering artifacts from Stage 2.1
  (`aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`), if brownfield
- User's project description from the intent's `audit/` shards

### Steps

1. **Load Prior Context** -- If brownfield: read RE artifacts from
   `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`. Read user's project
   description from the intent's `audit/` shards.

2. **Analyze User Request** -- Assess the request for:
   - **Clarity**: How well-defined is the request?
   - **Type**: New feature, enhancement, refactoring, bug fix, migration
   - **Scope**: Single component, multi-component, system-wide
   - **Complexity**: Simple, standard, complex

3. **Determine Depth** -- Based on complexity assessment:
   - **Minimal**: Clear request, narrow scope, well-understood domain
   - **Standard**: Moderate scope, some unknowns, multiple stakeholders
   - **Comprehensive**: Large scope, significant unknowns, complex domain

4. **Assess Current Requirements** -- Extract and organize what is already
   known from the user's input: explicit functional requirements, implied
   non-functional requirements, constraints and assumptions, business context
   and goals.

5. **Completeness Analysis** -- Evaluate coverage across six dimensions:
   1. Functional requirements -- core behaviors, features, use cases
   2. Non-functional requirements -- performance, security, scalability,
      reliability, observability
   3. User scenarios -- user workflows, edge cases, error scenarios
   4. Business context -- goals, success metrics, stakeholders, constraints
   5. Technical context -- integration points, platform requirements,
      technology constraints
   6. Quality attributes -- maintainability, testability, accessibility,
      usability

   Identify gaps in each dimension.

6. **Generate Clarifying Questions** -- PROACTIVE: always generate clarifying
   questions unless requirements are exceptionally clear and complete across
   all six dimensions. Create
   `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements-analysis-questions.md`
   using the `[Answer]:` tag format. Include context-appropriate questions with
   A-E options. Every ordinary clarifying question must end with `X. Other (please specify)` as
   the final option. All `[Answer]:` tags left blank.

   Offer the tri-mode question flow: Guide Me / Edit File / Chat.

7. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Read the questions file, confirm all
   `[Answer]:` tags are filled. If any are blank, present unanswered questions
   via AskUserQuestion and write answers back. Do NOT proceed with partial
   answers. Run:
   - MANDATORY ambiguity detection: scan all responses for vague language
     ("mix of", "not sure", "depends", "probably", "maybe")
   - Contradiction check between answers
   - Missing detail identification

8. **Follow-Up Questions** -- If ANY ambiguity, vagueness, or contradictions
   found, create follow-up questions targeting the specific issues. Resolve
   all ambiguities before proceeding. "When in doubt, ask."

9. **Generate Requirements** -- Create
    `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md` containing:
    - Intent analysis -- what the user is trying to achieve (goals, not just
      features)
    - Functional requirements -- organized by feature area or domain. Give
      every requirement a stable `FR{n}` ID (for example `FR1`) and every
      sub-requirement an `FR{n}.{m}` ID (for example `FR1.2`)
    - Non-functional requirements -- performance, security, scalability,
      reliability, and observability targets, each with a stable `NFR{n}` ID
    - Constraints -- technical, business, organizational
    - Assumptions -- documented with rationale
    - Out of scope -- explicitly excluded items
    - Open questions -- remaining uncertainties for later stages

10. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the requirements artifacts. Do not edit
    `<record>/aidlc-state.md`; the engine owns completion and routing.

11. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Display completion message
    with :mag: emoji and review path. The approval gate has two variants:

    **If User Stories is set to SKIP in the execution state:** 3-option gate:
    Approve / Request Changes / Add User Stories (include the currently
    skipped User Stories stage). If "Add User Stories" is selected, run
    `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts recompose --add user-stories`;
    do not edit the checkbox directly.

    **If User Stories is NOT set to SKIP:** Standard 2-option gate: Approve /
    Request Changes.

### Outputs

All artifacts written to `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/`:

| File                                 | Contents                                                |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `requirements.md`                    | Formal requirements: intent analysis, functional/non-functional requirements, constraints, assumptions, out-of-scope, open questions |
| `requirements-analysis-questions.md` | Clarifying questions with `[Answer]:` tags (input artifact) |

### Approval Gate

Conditional gate format:

- **If User Stories is skipped:** 3-option gate -- **Approve** / **Request
  Changes** / **Add User Stories**
- **If User Stories is not skipped:** Standard 2-option gate -- **Approve** /
  **Request Changes**

### Notes

- This is the most detailed question-and-answer stage in the workflow. It
  enforces mandatory ambiguity detection and will not proceed with partial or
  vague answers.
- Depth scales with complexity: minimal for bugfix/poc, standard for feature,
  comprehensive for enterprise.
- For bugfix scope, this stage captures the bug description at minimal depth.
- For infra scope, this stage captures infrastructure requirements.
- The requirements document produced here is consumed by User Stories (2.4),
  Refined Mockups (2.5), Domain Design (2.6), Units Generation (2.7),
  Contract Design (2.8), and Delivery Planning (2.9).

## Stage 2.4: User Stories

### Metadata

| Field            | Value                                                                  |

### Purpose

User Stories translates formal requirements into user-centered stories that
define the "who, what, and why" of each feature. The stage follows a two-part
structure: PART 1 creates a story plan with clarifying questions, and PART 2
generates the actual stories and personas. The plan and stories are presented
together at the completion gate for combined review.

This stage is the mob-elaboration showcase (mode: mob): the Product Manager
leads, and the design, developer, and quality agents are dispatched as
independent collaborators against the lead's draft - blind round, integrate,
one bounded objection round - with the Product Leader reviewing afterwards.
The aidlc-design-agent's user-experience perspective is a deliberate addition
not in the upstream reference, documented in SKILL.md's "Deliberate
Deviations" section.

### Inputs

- `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`
- RE artifacts from Stage 2.1
  (`aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`),
  if brownfield

### Steps

1. **Load the Lead Persona** -- Load aidlc-product-agent persona from
   `agents/aidlc-product-agent.md` and knowledge from
   `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-product-agent/`. The support agents (design,
   developer, quality) are NOT loaded inline - this is a mob stage; they are
   dispatched as independent collaborators during generation.

2. **Validate User Stories Are Needed** -- Assess whether user stories add
   value for this project:
   - **Execute if**: user-facing features, multiple user personas, complex
     business logic, cross-team coordination needed
   - **Skip if**: pure refactoring, isolated bug fixes, infrastructure-only,
     developer tooling

   Create `<record>/inception/user-stories/user-stories-assessment.md`
   documenting: decision (Execute or Skip), rationale, factors considered,
   key value areas (if executing) or alternative coverage (if skipping).

   If skipping, call `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage user-stories
   --result skipped --reason "<reason from the assessment>"`. The engine
   records `[S]` and routes before artifact or ensemble-evidence checks.

3. **Load Prior Context** -- Read
   `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`. If brownfield,
   read relevant RE artifacts from
   `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`.

**PART 1: Planning**

4. **Create Story Plan with Questions** -- Create
   `<record>/inception/user-stories/user-stories-questions.md` containing:
   - Persona development approach (who are the users, what are their goals)
   - Story format using INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable,
     Estimable, Small, Testable)
   - Story prioritization using MoSCoW priority (Must Have / Should Have /
     Could Have / Won't Have). The MVP boundary is formally decided during
     Delivery Planning; story priorities inform that decision.
   - Breakdown approach options (by feature, persona, workflow, domain area,
     or epic)
   - Embedded questions using `[Answer]:` tag format for user input on
     personas and story granularity

5. **Collect Answers** -- Collect answers following stage-protocol.md section 3
   question flow (offer interaction mode choice, collect answers, write back to
   file).

6. **Analyze Answers** -- MANDATORY ambiguity analysis: scan all responses for
   vague language ("mix of", "not sure", "depends", "probably"). Check for
   contradictions. Identify missing details. Create follow-up questions if ANY
   ambiguity found.

7. **Present Plan and Generate** -- Present the story plan summary (persona
   count, story count, breakdown approach) inline. Then immediately proceed to
   PART 2. The user reviews and approves the combined output (plan + generated
   stories) at the completion gate.

   If the user interjects with feedback before generation completes, treat it
   as a revision request and update the plan before continuing generation.

**PART 2: Generation**

8. **Execute Plan -- Generate Stories and Personas via the Mob**:

   **Lead draft.** The aidlc-product-agent first drafts
   `<record>/inception/user-stories/personas.md`:
   - User persona definitions (name, role, goals, pain points, context)
   - Persona relationships and priority ranking

   and `<record>/inception/user-stories/stories.md`:
   - User stories in standard format: "As a [persona], I want [goal], so that
     [benefit]"
   - Acceptance criteria for each story
   - Story priority (Must Have / Should Have / Could Have / Won't Have)
   - Story dependencies and relationships
   - INVEST compliance notes

   **Mutually blind support contributions.** Dispatch aidlc-design-agent,
   aidlc-developer-agent, and aidlc-quality-agent in one parallel round against
   the lead draft. Each brief contains the draft, Q&A, and requirements paths,
   but no sibling contribution. Each support agent writes its identity-marked
   file under
   `<record>/inception/user-stories/contributions/<agent-slug>.md`.

   **Lead integration.** The aidlc-product-agent integrates all three
   contributions into `personas.md` and `stories.md` before the completion
   gate. Judgment calls go to the human mid-stage; knowledge disputes get one
   bounded objection round. Maintained dissent is quoted at the gate.

9. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the mob artifacts and all three
   collaborator contribution files. Do not edit state; report the gate outcome
   through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

10. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Display completion message
    with :books: emoji, summary of personas and stories produced, and review
    path. Standard 2-option approval gate: Approve (continue to next stage) /
    Request Changes.

### Outputs

All artifacts written to `<record>/inception/user-stories/`:

| File                           | Contents                                                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stories.md`                   | User stories with acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies, INVEST notes |
| `personas.md`                  | User persona definitions, relationships, priority ranking    |
| `user-stories-assessment.md`   | Execute/skip decision with rationale and factors considered   |
| `user-stories-questions.md`    | Story plan with clarifying questions using `[Answer]:` tags (input artifact) |
| `contributions/aidlc-{design,developer,quality}-agent.md` | Mutually blind support contributions integrated by the lead before the gate |

### Approval Gate

Standard 2-option gate: **Approve** (continue to next stage) / **Request
Changes**.

### Notes

- Skip conditions: pure refactoring, isolated bug fixes, infrastructure-only,
  developer tooling.
- The two-part structure (plan then generate) allows the user to influence the
  story decomposition approach before stories are written.
- User story priorities (MoSCoW) inform but do not determine the MVP boundary.
  The formal MVP boundary is set during Delivery Planning (Stage 2.9).
- The `user-stories-assessment.md` artifact is always produced, even when the
  stage is skipped, to document the rationale.
- The three identity-marked contribution files are mandatory ensemble evidence;
  approval is refused until the lead has integrated all three.
- Stories produced here are consumed by Refined Mockups (2.5), Domain
  Design (2.6), Units Generation (2.7), and Delivery Planning (2.9).
- The aidlc-design-agent support is a deliberate addition for UX-informed
  development, noted in SKILL.md's Deliberate Deviations section.

| Support Agents   | aidlc-product-agent (validates against stories)                              |
| Mode             | inline                                                                 |
| Completion Emoji | :art:                                                                  |

### Purpose

Refined Mockups evolves the rough concept wireframes from Ideation Stage 1.6
into mid-to-high fidelity mockups informed by formal requirements and user
stories. It produces detailed interaction specifications, design system
mappings, responsive behavior definitions, and accessibility compliance
checklists.

For non-UI initiatives (API-only, backend), the stage refines interaction
diagrams into an API developer experience specification.

This stage is typically skipped if Stage 1.6 (Rough Mockups) was also skipped.

### Inputs

- Rough mockups from Stage 1.6 (`<record>/ideation/rough-mockups/`), if
  exists
- User stories from Stage 2.4 (`<record>/inception/user-stories/`)
- Requirements from Stage 2.3
  (`<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/`)

### Steps

1. **Load Prior Context** -- Read rough mockups from
   `<record>/ideation/rough-mockups/` (if exists). Read user stories from
   `<record>/inception/user-stories/`. Read requirements from
   `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/`.

2. **Generate Clarifying Questions** -- Create
   `<record>/inception/refined-mockups/refined-mockups-questions.md` with
   questions covering:
   - How each user story should be represented in the UI
   - Interaction patterns needed (modals, inline edits, wizards, progressive
     disclosure)
   - States each screen must handle (loading, empty, error, success, partial)
   - Alignment with existing design system / component library
   - Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)
   - Responsive breakpoints needed
   - For APIs: developer experience requirements

   Follows stage-protocol.md question flow.

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Validate design decisions against user
   stories and requirements for consistency.

4. **Generate Artifacts** -- Create mid-to-high fidelity mockups (per user
   story/screen), interaction specification document, design system mapping,
   responsive behavior specification, and accessibility compliance checklist.
   For non-UI initiatives, create API developer experience specification.

5. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the refined-mockup artifacts. Do not edit
   state; report the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

6. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Display completion message
   with :art: emoji. Standard approval gate (Approve / Request Changes).

### Outputs

All artifacts written to `<record>/inception/refined-mockups/`:

| File                            | Contents                                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mockups.md`                    | Mid-to-high fidelity mockups per user story/screen          |
| `interaction-spec.md`           | Interaction patterns, state management, transitions          |
| `design-system-mapping.md`      | Component mapping to design system / component library       |
| `accessibility-checklist.md`    | WCAG compliance checklist and requirements                   |
| `refined-mockups-questions.md`  | Clarifying questions with `[Answer]:` tags (input artifact)  |

### Approval Gate

Standard 2-option gate: **Approve** / **Request Changes**.

### Notes

- Skip condition: non-UI, API-only, or infrastructure-only initiatives. Also
  typically skipped if Stage 1.6 (Rough Mockups) was skipped.
- For mvp scope, this stage executes only if the project has UI.
- The mockups produced here feed into Domain Design (2.6) and ultimately
  into Construction's Code Generation (3.5) for UI components.
- The accessibility checklist provides testable criteria that feed into Build
  and Test (3.6).

## Stage 2.6: Domain Design

### Metadata

| Field            | Value                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase            | Inception                                                              |
| Stage #          | 2.6                                                                    |
| Condition        | CONDITIONAL -- execute when new components or services are needed; skip for modifications to existing components only |
| Lead Agent       | aidlc-architect-agent                                                        |
| Support Agents   | aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-design-agent                                |
| Mode             | inline                                                                 |
| Completion Emoji | :building_construction:                                                |

### Purpose

Domain Design identifies the **logical building blocks** of the system — the
components you write code for. A component is a bounded piece of software with
its own business logic, entities, and lifecycle (code you write, not
infrastructure you deploy). This stage captures each component's behaviour,
its dependencies and dependents, and the entities it owns, plus the rationale
for each boundary. It does NOT decide deployment topology (that is Units
Generation) or tech stack / NFR patterns (later stages).

The aidlc-aws-platform-agent provides supporting perspective on managed-service
dependencies; the aidlc-design-agent contributes UI component structure.

### Inputs

- `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`
- `<record>/inception/user-stories/stories.md` (if produced)
- RE artifacts from Stage 2.1 (especially `architecture.md`,
  `component-inventory.md`, `dependencies.md`), if brownfield

### Steps

1. **Load Prior Context** -- Read requirements, user stories (if produced),
   and RE artifacts (if brownfield, especially architecture.md,
   component-inventory.md, dependencies.md). Scope context comes from
   `<record>/aidlc-state.md`.

2. **Create Design Plan with Questions** -- Create
   `<record>/inception/domain-design/domain-design-questions.md`
   with context-appropriate questions using `[Answer]:` tag format covering:
   - Component boundary decisions
   - Architectural style preferences (if not already decided)
   - Service communication patterns (sync vs. async, REST vs. gRPC vs.
     events)
   - Data ownership and storage strategy
   - Integration approach with existing components (brownfield)
   - UI component structure (if user-facing, informed by UX designer
     perspective)

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Collect answers following
   stage-protocol.md section 3 question flow. MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
   scan for vague language, contradictions, missing details. Create follow-up
   questions if ANY ambiguity found. Resolve all ambiguities before proceeding.

4. **Generate the Component Catalogue** -- Create the single consolidated
   `components.md` (see Outputs below): a fenced `yaml` catalogue (source of
   truth) plus the derived human view (mermaid diagram + summary/ownership/
   rationale tables).

5. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the design artifacts. Do not edit state;
   report the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

6. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Display completion message
   with :building_construction: emoji, summary of design artifacts, key
   architectural decisions highlighted, and review path. 3-option approval
   gate: Approve / Request Changes / Add Units Generation (if it was skipped
   in execution plan). Selecting Add Units Generation runs
   `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts recompose --add units-generation`;
   it never edits the state checkbox directly.

### Outputs

The artifacts written to `<record>/inception/domain-design/`:

| File                              | Contents                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `components.md`                   | Fenced `yaml` component catalogue (source of truth): each component's `behaviour`, `responsibilities`, `depends_on`/`dependents`, `external_dependencies`, and owned `entities` (with `identifier`, attributes, and cross-component `references`). Followed by the derived human view: mermaid Component Diagram, Component Summary, Entity Ownership, External Dependencies, and Rationale tables |
| `decisions.md`                    | The ADR log — architecture decision records capturing key design decisions and their rationale |
| `traceability.json`               | Coverage table mapping each upstream `USx.y` (or fallback `FR`) to the component or entity in `components.md` that realizes it; validated by the `traceability` sensor |

Additionally, a questions file is created as input:

| File                                      | Contents                                        |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `domain-design-questions.md`         | Design questions with `[Answer]:` tags          |

### Approval Gate

Special 3-option gate:

- **Approve** -- Continue to next stage
- **Request Changes** -- Provide revision feedback
- **Add Units Generation** -- Include the currently skipped Units Generation
  stage (if it was skipped in the execution plan) via
  `aidlc-utility.ts recompose --add units-generation`

### Notes

- Skip condition: changes are modifications to existing components only, with
  no new components or services needed.
- Boundary rationale (and any Alternatives Rejected) is captured in the
  Rationale section of `components.md`, and architectural decisions are
  logged in `decisions.md` (the ADR log).
- The design artifacts produced here are the primary input for Units Generation
  (2.7) and directly inform Construction stages (Functional Design 3.1, Code
  Generation 3.5).
- For brownfield projects, the design must account for integration with
  existing components documented in the RE artifacts.

### Purpose

Units Generation decomposes the domain design into discrete Units of
Work that drive the phased construction flow in the Construction phase. Each
Unit represents an independently implementable piece of the system (a
service, module, or deployable component). The stage produces the
`unit-of-work.md` file that Construction uses to determine what to build,
the dependency DAG (`unit-of-work-dependency.md`) that Stage 2.9 consumes
for Bolt sequencing, and the story map that ensures every user story is
assigned to a Unit.

**Stage 2.7 produces the dependency DAG (topology). Stage 2.9 chooses the
economic path through it (the Bolt sequence).** 2.7 MUST NOT recommend an
implementation order or identify a critical path — those are 2.9's
economic-sequencing decisions.

This is a critical bridge stage between Inception's design work and
Construction's implementation work. The unit definitions, dependencies, and
story mappings produced here directly control how the Construction phase
executes.

The stage follows a two-part structure: PART 1 creates a decomposition plan
with clarifying questions and gets plan approval, and PART 2 generates the
actual unit artifacts.

### Inputs

- The component catalogue from Stage 2.6
  (`<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md`)
- `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`
- `<record>/inception/user-stories/stories.md` (if produced)

### Steps

**PART 1: Planning**

1. **Load Prior Context** -- Read all artifacts from
   `<record>/inception/domain-design/` (the consolidated `components.md`
   component catalogue and the `decisions.md` ADR log). Read
   requirements. Read user stories (if produced). Scope context comes from
   `<record>/aidlc-state.md`.

2. **Create Decomposition Plan with Questions** -- Create
   `<record>/inception/units-generation/units-generation-questions.md` with
   questions using `[Answer]:` tag format covering:
   - Unit boundary strategy (by service, by feature, by domain, by deployment
     target)
   - Unit granularity preference (coarse-grained vs. fine-grained)
   - Dependency ordering preferences (strict topological only, or allow
     parallelism between independent Units)
   - Integration points and contracts between Units (APIs, shared data, events)
   - Deployment model (monolithic deploy, independent deploy, hybrid)

   NOTE: Do NOT ask about implementation order priorities (value-first,
   risk-first, walking-skeleton-first). Those are economic-sequencing
   decisions that belong to Stage 2.9 Delivery Planning.

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Collect answers following
   stage-protocol.md section 3 question flow. MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
   scan for vague language, contradictions, missing details. Create follow-up
   questions if ANY ambiguity found. Resolve all ambiguities before proceeding.

4. **Get Plan Approval** -- Present the decomposition plan to the user via
   AskUserQuestion: summarize the approach (unit boundary strategy, estimated
   unit count, dependency structure). Options: Approve Plan / Revise Plan.

**PART 2: Generation**

5. **Execute Plan -- Generate Unit Artifacts** -- Based on the approved plan,
   generate the 4 output artifacts (see Outputs below).

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the unit artifacts and record the unit
   list for Construction. Do not edit state; report the gate outcome through
   `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

7. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Display completion message
   with :wrench: emoji, summary of units defined, dependencies mapped, stories
   assigned, and review path. Standard 2-option approval gate: Approve
   (continue to Construction phase) / Request Changes.

### Outputs

All 4 artifacts written to `<record>/inception/units-generation/`:

| File                            | Contents                                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unit-of-work.md`               | Unit definitions (name, description, boundaries), responsibilities, deployment model per Unit (standalone/shared/embedded), relative complexity estimate (S/M/L/XL), unit kind (`service`/`spec`/`ui`/`packaging`/`library`, drives which construction design artifacts apply), implementation notes and constraints |
| `unit-of-work-dependency.md`    | Dependency DAG between Units (directed edges, cycle-free), integration points (APIs/shared data/events), parallel development opportunities (sets of Units with no dependency between them). Topology only, economic path-choice (recommended order, critical path) is 2.9's job. The fenced `yaml` edge block mirrors the DAG and may tag each unit with an optional `kind:` (see [Runtime graph](../13-runtime-graph.md) `bolt_dag.units[].kind`) |
| `unit-of-work-story-map.md`     | Each user story mapped to implementing Unit(s), cross-cutting stories spanning multiple Units, story implementation order within each Unit, coverage verification (every story assigned, every Unit has stories) |
| `traceability.json`             | Coverage table deriving the Unit set from the generated Unit artifacts and verifying every story maps to its declared target Unit; validated by the `traceability` sensor |

Additionally, a questions file is created as input:

| File                                  | Contents                                          |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `units-generation-questions.md`       | Decomposition questions with `[Answer]:` tags     |

### Approval Gate

Standard 2-option gate: **Approve** (continue to Construction phase) /
**Request Changes**.

### Notes

- **This stage's output drives Construction.** The `unit-of-work.md` file
  defines the Units; `unit-of-work-dependency.md` is the DAG the Construction
  engine walks. The default walk is stage-major: one in-scope Construction
  stage runs for every Unit, then the next stage. Opt-in
  `Construction Iteration: unit-major` is the walk that finishes one Unit's
  per-unit stages before the next Unit begins.
- **2.7 is ALWAYS when in scope.** In the compiled scope grid, 2.7 and 2.9 travel
  together (both EXECUTE or both SKIP per scope). There is no single-unit
  skip condition at this stage — single-Unit flows still produce a trivial
  DAG.
- The two-part structure (plan then generate) allows the user to approve the
  decomposition strategy before Units are defined. Step 4 has an intermediate
  approval gate (Approve Plan / Revise Plan) separate from the final
  completion gate.
- The dependency DAG feeds 2.9's economic Bolt sequencing. 2.9 chooses a
  path through the DAG weighted by risk, value, and learning.
- The story map provides traceability: every user story must be assigned to at
  least one Unit, and every Unit must have at least one story.
- The aidlc-delivery-agent provides feasibility validation and prioritization input,
  ensuring the decomposition is practical from a delivery perspective.

| Lead Agent       | aidlc-architect-agent                                                        |

| Completion Emoji | :building_construction:                                                |

### Purpose

Contract Design formalises the system's **formal contracts** so that units can
be built in parallel against a stable, agreed boundary. It runs after Units
Generation (2.7) has defined the units and their dependency DAG, and pins two
kinds of contract: the inter-unit boundaries (the sync/async/shared-store
mechanisms by which units integrate) and any public or external API the system
exposes. It produces a single `contract-summary.md` that downstream design and
construction stages read as the authoritative boundary reference.

### Inputs

- `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work.md` and
  `unit-of-work-dependency.md`
- `<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md`
- `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`

### Outputs

- `contract-summary.md` -- the pinned inter-unit and external contracts.

### Notes

- Contract Design is skipped only for a single self-contained unit that has no
  inter-unit boundary and exposes no public/external API; a single unit that
  exposes a public API still runs it.
- `contract-summary` is consumed downstream by Delivery Planning, Functional
  Design, NFR Requirements, NFR Design, Infrastructure Design, and Code
  Generation as an optional shared-contract input.
- Unlike the other Inception design stages, Contract Design does not emit a
  `traceability.json`; it owns formal contracts rather than requirement
  coverage, so it does not contribute to the 2.9 phase-boundary traceability
  check.

## Stage 2.9: Delivery Planning

### Purpose

Delivery Planning is the capstone of the Inception phase. It plans the Bolt
sequence — the economic order in which Units of Work produced by Stage 2.7
should ship. Where Stage 2.7 is analytical (the dependency DAG the
Construction engine actually walks), Stage 2.9 is economic: it chooses a
path through the DAG weighted by risk, value, team capacity, and learning.
The engine does not consume `bolt-plan.md` for Unit grouping or runtime
order.

Per the canonical Glossary in `stage-protocol.md`, a **Bolt** is the
planned Construction delivery slice from this stage (2.9): one or more
Units with a Definition of Done, a confidence hypothesis, and ownership.
(Stages 3.6 build-and-test and 3.7 ci-pipeline run once at end across
all Units, not per-Bolt.)

Economic value cannot be derived from the DAG — AI agents can topologically
sort, but they cannot decide which Bolt validates the market hypothesis
fastest or which surfaces the scariest unknown before commitments compound.
That is a human value judgment captured in this stage.

This stage also runs the phase boundary verification check that validates
the integrity of all Inception artifacts before transitioning to
Construction.

**Important distinction:** This stage plans Bolt sequencing. It does NOT
decide which AI-DLC stages to run or at what depth -- that is handled by the
`/aidlc` skill's scope selection.

### Inputs

All Inception phase artifacts:

- Requirements from Stage 2.3 (`<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/`)
- User stories from Stage 2.4 (`<record>/inception/user-stories/`)
- Domain design from Stage 2.6
  (`<record>/inception/domain-design/`)
- Units from Stage 2.7 (`<record>/inception/units-generation/`)
- Contract summary from Stage 2.8, if produced
  (`<record>/inception/contract-design/contract-summary.md`)
- Team formation from Stage 1.5
  (`<record>/ideation/team-formation/`), if exists

### Steps

1. **Load Prior Context** -- Read all Inception phase artifacts: requirements,
   user stories, domain design, units, the contract summary (if produced), and
   team formation (if exists).

2. **Generate Clarifying Questions** -- Create
   `<record>/inception/delivery-planning/delivery-planning-questions.md`
   with questions covering:
   - Sequencing heuristic: risk-first, value-first, walking-skeleton-first,
     or hybrid
   - WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) scoring model and weightings if used
   - The first Bolt: walking skeleton (Cockburn) or confidence-building
     slice that proves the approach before scaling
   - Bundling of Units of Work into Bolts
   - Definition of Done for each Bolt
   - Confidence hypothesis per Bolt — what will shipping it prove
   - Mob-to-Bolt assignment (references teams from 1.5 when available;
     AI-only when it did not run)
   - External dependencies (APIs, data, approvals) that gate specific Bolts
   - Key risk items to tackle earliest

   Follows stage-protocol.md question flow.

3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Validate that the chosen Bolt
   sequence respects 2.7's dependency DAG (with aidlc-architect-agent input).
   Flag any deviation from topological order so it can be justified in the
   rationale artifact.

4. **Generate Artifacts** -- Create four artifacts in
   `<record>/inception/delivery-planning/`:
   - `bolt-plan.md` — the ordered sequence of Bolts; per-Bolt Units of
     Work, walking-skeleton marker, Definition of Done, confidence
     hypothesis, expected demo.
   - `team-allocation.md` — Bolt-to-mob assignments; Program Board analog
     when team count > 1.
   - `risk-and-sequencing-rationale.md` — the why behind the Bolt order:
     WSJF score, risk-first argument, walking-skeleton-first argument, or
     value-first argument.
   - `external-dependency-map.md` — gated items mapped to consuming Bolts
     (lightweight or empty when fully AI-contained).

5. **Phase Boundary Verification** -- Run Inception-to-Construction
   verification check:
   - Requirements to Stories to Architecture alignment
   - All stories trace to requirements
   - Architecture covers all stories
   - Write results to `<record>/verification/phase-check-inception.md`

6. **Prepare Completion** -- Verify the delivery and boundary-verification
   artifacts. Do not write the phase or stage state; the approval report owns
   the atomic Inception-to-Construction transition. Classify the approved
   Bolt plan's Construction iteration. A unit-first plan may record
   `set-construction-iteration unit-major`. Then ask whether one session or
   several teams own Units; team ownership records `set-unit-ownership team`
   (unit-major required) and asks whether approvals happen after every stage
   (`set-unit-gate-rhythm per-stage`, default) or once after the Unit chain
   (`unit-end`). The user-facing questions explain those choices without
   exposing field/enum names.

7. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Display completion message
   with :calendar: emoji. Approval gate: Approve (proceed to Construction) /
   Request Changes. The user can override stage inclusion/exclusion at this
   gate.

### Outputs

All artifacts written to `<record>/inception/delivery-planning/`:

| File                                  | Contents                                                    |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bolt-plan.md`                        | Ordered Bolt sequence; per-Bolt Units of Work, walking-skeleton marker, Definition of Done, confidence hypothesis, expected demo |

| `risk-and-sequencing-rationale.md`    | WSJF / risk-first / walking-skeleton-first / value-first justification for the Bolt ordering |
| `external-dependency-map.md`          | Gated items (external APIs, data availability, approval lead times, external-team hand-offs) mapped to consuming Bolts |
| `delivery-planning-questions.md`      | Clarifying questions with `[Answer]:` tags (input artifact) |

Phase boundary verification output:

| File                                            | Contents                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `<record>/verification/phase-check-inception.md` | Inception-to-Construction traceability check results |

### Approval Gate

Standard 2-option gate: **Approve** (proceed to Construction) / **Request
Changes**. The user can override stage inclusion/exclusion at this gate.

### Notes

- **Phase boundary stage.** This is the second of three phase boundary stages
  (after 1.7 and before 3.7). The verification check validates
  Requirements-to-Stories-to-Architecture alignment.
- **Economic vs topological sequencing.** Stage 2.7 produces the dependency
  DAG (topological order falls out as descriptive geometry). Stage 2.9
  chooses a path through that DAG weighted by human value judgment.
  Bolt order may deviate from topological order when risk-first or
  walking-skeleton-first arguments justify it — the deviation is captured
  in `risk-and-sequencing-rationale.md`.
- **Bolt ≠ sprint ≠ MMF.** Per the canonical Glossary, a Bolt is the
  planned Construction delivery slice from 2.9: one or more Units with a
  Definition of Done, a confidence hypothesis, and ownership. Stages 3.6
  (Build and Test) and 3.7 (CI Pipeline) run once after all Bolts.
  Sequencing heuristics (walking skeleton, WSJF) apply to Bolt order;
  they do not redefine what a Bolt is.
- **Deliberate deviation from upstream.** The upstream reference calls this
  stage "Workflow Planning" and treats it as a pure stage selector. This
  implementation (renamed to "Delivery Planning") adds Bolt sequencing,
  team allocation, and risk rationale.
- The bolt plan defines a confidence-building sequence. Each Bolt has
  defined Units of Work, a Definition of Done, and a confidence hypothesis.
- The aidlc-architect-agent validates that the proposed Bolt sequence respects
  dependencies defined in the component catalogue (`components.md`) and the
  unit-of-work-dependency artifact.
- Team allocation draws from the Team Formation artifacts (Stage 1.5) if
  they exist; when 1.5 is SKIP (mvp, classic, workshop), all Bolts are executed by
  aidlc-developer-agent (AI).

## Phase Summary

### Key Outputs

The Inception phase produces the following key outputs that carry forward into
Construction and Operation:

1. **Reverse Engineering Artifacts** (2.1) -- 9 artifacts per repository at
   `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`, documenting the existing
   codebase: business overview, architecture, code structure, API documentation,
   component inventory, technology stack, dependencies, code quality
   assessment, and timestamp. (Brownfield projects only.)
2. **Requirements Document** (2.3) -- Formal requirements: functional,
   non-functional, constraints, assumptions, out-of-scope, open questions.
3. **User Stories and Personas** (2.4) -- User stories with acceptance
   criteria, priorities, and dependencies; user persona definitions. (When
   applicable.)
4. **Refined Mockups** (2.5) -- Mid-to-high fidelity mockups, interaction
   specifications, design system mapping, accessibility checklist. (When
   applicable.)
5. **Domain Design** (2.6) -- The consolidated `components.md` catalogue
   (each component's behaviour, responsibilities, dependencies, external
   dependencies, and owned entities) plus the `decisions.md` ADR log.
   (When applicable.)
6. **Units of Work** (2.7) -- Unit definitions with boundaries and complexity
   estimates, unit dependency matrix with build order, story-to-unit mapping.
   (When applicable.) `unit-of-work-dependency.md` is the artifact the
   Construction engine reads for Unit grouping and runtime batch order.
7. **Contract Summary** (2.8) -- The pinned inter-unit and public/external API
   contracts (`contract-summary.md`). (When there is a contract to pin.)
8. **Delivery Plan** (2.9) -- Bolt plan, build order, dependency matrix, team
   allocation. Approved planning content (economic sequence, multi-Unit
   grouping, DoD, confidence hypothesis, ownership) — not the runtime walk
   source.
9. **Phase Boundary Verification** (2.9) -- Inception-to-Construction
   traceability check written to
   `<record>/verification/phase-check-inception.md`.

### Handoff to Construction

Upon approval at Stage 2.9, the framework transitions to the Construction
phase. `bolt-plan.md` stays the approved planning artifact — economic
sequence, multi-Unit Bolt grouping, Definition of Done, confidence
hypothesis, and ownership. The engine does **not** consume it for Unit
grouping or walk order. Runtime batches are computed from
`unit-of-work-dependency.md` (2.7).

The shipped default walk is **stage-major**: one in-scope Construction
stage runs for every Unit, then the next stage, with Code Generation last.
The walking-skeleton gate is the first in-scope Construction EXECUTE stage.
After that gate, the ladder prompt records `Construction Autonomy Mode`.
Opt-in `Construction Iteration: unit-major` walks one Unit through every
per-unit stage before the next Unit; it suppresses swarm and keeps the
per-stage gate cascade.

1. **3.1 Functional Design** (conditional per scope / execution plan) — every Unit
2. **3.2 NFR Requirements** (conditional) — every Unit
3. **3.3 NFR Design** (conditional) — every Unit
4. **3.4 Infrastructure Design** (conditional) — every Unit
5. **3.5 Code Generation** (always) — every Unit; under an autonomous swarm,
   one stage gate after the final DAG batch
6. **3.6 Build and Test** (always) — once at the end
7. **3.7 CI Pipeline** (conditional) — once at the end

See `docs/guide/04-phases-and-stages.md` for the current Construction walk.
