# Ideation Phase -- Stage Reference (1.1-1.7)

## Phase Overview

The Ideation phase is the second of five phases in the AI-DLC lifecycle. It
establishes the foundation for the entire initiative by capturing intent,
validating feasibility, defining scope, and securing approval before any
technical work begins. The phase runs stages 1.1 through 1.7 and concludes
with a go/no-go gate that controls entry into the Inception phase.

All seven stages execute inline (no subagent delegation) and follow the
standard stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion
messages. The orchestrator routes through them sequentially, skipping
CONDITIONAL stages that do not apply to the current scope.

**Key characteristics of the Ideation phase:**

- Every stage uses inline execution mode (direct conversation with the user).
- Stages produce artifacts under the intent's record dir at `<record>/ideation/<stage-name>/`, where `<record>` is `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/` (the `audit/` shard dir, the per-stage `memory.md`, and the verification reports live under the same record dir).
- All stages except Stage 1.1 depend on outputs from earlier stages.
- Stage 1.7 runs a phase boundary verification check before handing off to
  Inception.
- The phase is bookended by two ALWAYS stages (1.1 Intent Capture and 1.7
  Approval & Handoff); the five middle stages are CONDITIONAL and may be
  skipped depending on scope.

**Scope-driven stage inclusion:**

### Purpose

Intent Capture is the entry point of every AI-DLC workflow. It captures the
business problem, identifies stakeholders, establishes success metrics, and
classifies the project type (greenfield, brownfield, or migration). The
resulting intent statement and stakeholder map become the foundation that all
downstream stages build upon.

If the user provided freeform intent text via `$ARGUMENTS`, that text is passed
as seed context so the stage does not re-ask "what do you want to build?"

### Inputs

- User's project description from `$ARGUMENTS` or the intent's `audit/` shards
- Existing `<record>/` artifacts from prior sessions (if any)
- Guardrails from `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/`

### Steps

1. **Load Prior Context** -- Read user's project description. Check for existing artifacts. Load guardrails.
2. **Generate Clarifying Questions** -- Create `<record>/ideation/intent-capture/intent-capture-questions.md` with a `## Sources` register for the initial description, workflow-selected scope, and any active-memory rules used. Ask about the business problem, customer, success metrics, initiative trigger, stakeholders, decision authority, communication needs, and whether the workflow-selected scope matches the intended product boundary. Uses `[Answer]:` tag format with A-E options plus X (Other). Offers tri-mode question flow.
3. **Collect and Analyze Answers** -- Confirm all tags filled. Run ambiguity/contradiction analysis.
4. **Generate Grounded Artifacts** -- Produce the intent statement and stakeholder map. Every substantive paragraph, list item, and table data row carries an inline `[desc]`, `[scope]`, `[Q<n>]`, `[memory:<id>]`, or `[assumption]` tag. Both files include `## Assumptions & Open Questions`.
5. **Resolve Assumptions** -- If either artifact retains an assumption, ask the user to accept it or convert it into follow-up questions. Acceptance preserves the assumption label; it does not promote the claim to fact.
6. **Prepare Completion** -- Run Product Lead review, verify both artifacts, and report
   the gate outcome through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.
7. **Present Completion & Request Approval** -- Standard 2-option gate.

### Outputs

| File                          | Contents                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `intent-statement.md`         | Source-tagged Problem Statement, Target Customer, Success Metrics, Initiative Trigger, and workflow-selected vs. user-confirmed Initial Scope Signal; mandatory assumptions section |
| `stakeholder-map.md`          | Source-tagged stakeholders and interests, decision-makers vs. influencers, communication requirements; mandatory assumptions section |
| `intent-capture-questions.md` | Permitted-source register, clarifying questions with `[Answer]:` tags, and assumption confirmation when needed |

### Notes

- First stage of every workflow. No prior artifacts other than user input.
- Freeform intent in `$ARGUMENTS` is used as seed context.
- Unselected options are not exclusions or requirements. Unsupported content is
  omitted, elicited in a follow-up, or retained only as an explicit assumption.
- The intent statement feeds every subsequent Ideation stage and carries forward into Inception.

### Purpose

Compiles all Ideation artifacts into a single initiative brief, records all decisions, runs phase boundary verification, and presents a go/no-go gate.

### Inputs

All Ideation phase artifacts from stages 1.1-1.6.

### Steps

1. Load aidlc-delivery-agent persona and knowledge.
2. Read ALL Ideation phase artifacts.
3. Generate approval questions.
4. Compile initiative brief (one-pager combining all outputs).
5. Phase boundary verification (Intent -> Scope -> Intent Backlog consistency).
6. Verify the handoff and phase-boundary artifacts; do not edit lifecycle
   state directly.
7. Present the 3-option approval gate. On approval, report the outcome so the
   engine completes the stage and transitions to Inception atomically.

### Outputs

### Approval Gate

Special 3-option gate:

- **Approve** -- Proceed to Inception phase
- **Request Changes** -- Provide revision feedback
- **Reject Initiative** -- End the workflow entirely

### Notes

- Phase boundary stage -- runs verification per stage-protocol governance.
- Initiative brief serves as executive summary for the entire Ideation phase.

## Phase Summary

### Key Outputs

1. **Intent Statement** (1.1) -- Problem statement, target customer, success metrics, project classification.
2. **Stakeholder Map** (1.1) -- Key stakeholders, decision-makers, communication requirements.
3. **Competitive Analysis** (1.2) -- Market positioning, build-vs-buy (when applicable).
4. **Feasibility Assessment and RAID Log** (1.3) -- Technical viability, risk register, constraints (when applicable).
5. **Scope Document and Intent Backlog** (1.4) -- Authoritative scope boundary, prioritized proto-unit list.
6. **Team Plan** (1.5) -- Skill matrix, mob composition, capacity allocation (when applicable).
7. **Concept Mockups** (1.6) -- Wireframes/user flows or system context diagrams (when applicable).
8. **Initiative Brief** (1.7) -- Executive one-pager synthesizing all Ideation outputs.
9. **Phase Boundary Verification** (1.7) -- Traceability check results.

### Handoff to Inception

Upon approval at Stage 1.7, the framework transitions to the Inception
phase. Inception begins with Stage 2.1 Reverse Engineering (for brownfield
projects) or Stage 2.3 Requirements Analysis (for greenfield projects).
