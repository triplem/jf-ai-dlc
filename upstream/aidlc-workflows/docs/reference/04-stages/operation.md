# Operation Phase -- Stage Reference (4.1-4.7)

## Phase Overview

The Operation phase is the fifth of five phases in the AI-DLC lifecycle. It
takes the built, tested software from Construction and moves it through
deployment, monitoring, incident preparedness, performance validation, and
continuous optimization. It covers seven stages (4.1 through 4.7) that span
pipeline configuration, environment provisioning, deployment execution,
observability, incident response, performance validation, and feedback
collection.

All seven Operation stages are **CONDITIONAL** -- they execute based on the
scope and execution plan. For example, mvp and poc skip Operation entirely.
Bugfix, refactor, infra, security-patch, and express run deployment-focused
subsets.

All stages run **inline** (no subagents in the Operation phase). All stages
follow `stage-protocol.md` for approval gates, question format, completion
messages, and state tracking.

| Stage | Name                     | Execution   | Condition                                                              | Lead Agent          | Support Agents      | Mode                             |
|-------|--------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| 4.1   | Deployment Pipeline      | CONDITIONAL | Execute when CD pipeline needs creation or significant modification    | aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent| (none)             | inline                           |
| 4.2   | Environment Provisioning | CONDITIONAL | Execute when AWS environments need provisioning or validation          | aidlc-aws-platform-agent  | aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent     | inline                           |
| 4.3   | Deployment Execution     | CONDITIONAL | Execute after deployment pipeline and environment are ready            | aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent| aidlc-developer-agent    | inline                           |
| 4.4   | Observability Setup      | CONDITIONAL | Execute when monitoring, dashboards, alarms, or tracing need config    | aidlc-operations-agent    | (none)              | inline                           |
| 4.5   | Incident Response        | CONDITIONAL | Execute when operational runbooks and incident response procedures needed | aidlc-operations-agent | (none)              | inline                           |
| 4.6   | Performance Validation   | CONDITIONAL | Execute when NFR performance targets need validation under load        | aidlc-quality-agent       | (none)              | inline                           |
| 4.7   | Feedback & Optimization  | CONDITIONAL | Execute when ongoing operational monitoring and optimization needed    | aidlc-operations-agent    | aidlc-aws-platform-agent  | inline                           |

### Multi-Agent Stages

Three Operation stages involve multiple agents:

- **4.2 Environment Provisioning**: aidlc-aws-platform-agent (lead) + aidlc-devsecops-agent (security posture validation) + aidlc-compliance-agent (data residency, regulatory controls)
- **4.3 Deployment Execution**: aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent (lead) + aidlc-developer-agent (database migrations)
- **4.7 Feedback & Optimization**: aidlc-operations-agent (lead) + aidlc-aws-platform-agent (cost optimization, drift detection)

In all cases, the conductor invokes the lead agent first, then invokes
support agents with the lead's output as context. The conductor performs
every delegation; agents never invoke each other.

3. **Start New Ideation Cycle** -- Feed the feedback-loop.md insights back into a new Stage 1.1.

This reflects the cyclical nature of the AI-DLC lifecycle.
