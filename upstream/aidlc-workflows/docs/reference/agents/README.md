## Shared Configuration

All 14 authored agents share a common frontmatter baseline. On Claude Code, none declares a `tools:` allowlist, so every agent inherits the **full session toolset** plus provisioned MCP tools, with `disallowedTools: Task` as the nested-delegation denial. Other harnesses project that intent into native policy: Kiro agent Markdown omits the unsupported key, while Kiro CLI JSON and Kiro IDE `tools:` grants exclude `subagent` from delegates. The two review-only agents additionally carry `maxTurns: 60` - a hard turn backstop enforced natively where the harness has a lever: on Claude Code the frontmatter key is binding (the sub-agent is stopped mid-task, no final message), and on opencode the packager projects it to the native per-agent `steps: 60` (the runner grants one final text-only turn - a summary can return, but no tool call can write the review). Codex TOML personas carry the number as prose only (a TOML persona has no frontmatter, so the emit rewrites the citation), and Cursor, Copilot, and Kiro expose no per-agent cap key (the inert `maxTurns:` key still ships on the .md surfaces that tolerate unknown keys; the kiro agent JSONs never receive it). Section 12a's incomplete-attempt guard turns a review cut off at the cap into one retried dispatch and then a NOT-READY finding instead of a silently missing verdict - and the conductor deletes any pre-existing `## Review` section before every dispatch, so a stale verdict can never stand in for a missing one.

### The Claude Code session toolset

Every Claude Code agent inherits the built-in tools, including:

| Claude Code Tool | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| Read | Read files from the filesystem |
| Edit | Perform exact string replacements in files |
| Write | Write files to the filesystem |
| Glob | Fast file pattern matching |
| Grep | Content search using ripgrep |
| AskUserQuestion | Interactive user prompts (main-thread stages only) |

### Common Disallowed Claude Code Tools

| Claude Code Tool | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| Task | Agents operate as delegated workers. The conductor performs the `Task` call; Claude enforces `disallowedTools: Task`, while other harnesses use their native deny/allowlist equivalent. |

### Tools each persona is expected to exercise

On Claude Code, every agent *can* reach Bash and WebSearch by inheritance; the table records which personas the methodology **expects** to use them, not a per-agent grant. To genuinely restrict a Claude persona, add an optional `tools:` allowlist (which drops inherited MCP unless `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids are also listed).

| Claude Code Tool | Expected to exercise it |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Bash | aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-developer-agent, aidlc-quality-agent, aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent, aidlc-operations-agent |
| WebSearch | aidlc-product-agent, aidlc-design-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent |

### Agent Tiers

| Tier | Agents |
|------|--------|
| judgment | aidlc-architect-agent, aidlc-product-agent, aidlc-design-agent, aidlc-developer-agent, aidlc-quality-agent, aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent, aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-composer-agent |
| balanced | aidlc-architecture-reviewer-agent, aidlc-product-lead-agent |
| templated | aidlc-delivery-agent, aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent, aidlc-operations-agent |

Every shipped agent declares a `tier:` in its authored frontmatter; the
packager projects it into each harness's native model/effort keys (on Claude
Code: judgment -> `model: inherit` with no effort pin, balanced -> `model:
sonnet` + `effort: medium`, templated -> `model: sonnet` + `effort: medium`).
A judgment agent is therefore never downgraded below the session's own model
and effort. An agent is templated only when its output is dominantly
pattern-following — delivery plans, CI/CD YAML, observability and runbook
scaffolding — and the methodology is already encoded in the agent's knowledge
files.

The nine judgment agents share one property: their work requires
multi-constraint reasoning whose decisions cascade downstream. Architectural
boundaries, interpretation of ambiguous intent, UX trade-offs, code synthesis
under dense context, risk-based test strategy, threat prioritisation,
regulatory edge-cases, and cloud architecture trade-offs all fall in this
category. The two balanced reviewers evaluate novel input against explicit
criteria — the checklist encodes the method, so a mid-size model at `medium`
effort suffices. Balanced and templated currently project identically on Claude
Code, Codex, and opencode but remain distinct so either can be retuned; on Kiro,
Cursor, and Copilot all tiers inherit the session model and effort. See the
projection table and the `tier_cap` override in
[Agent System](../05-agent-system.md).

## Agent Comparison Matrix

`Yes` in the next two columns means the methodology expects the persona to use
that inherited tool; it does not grant or withhold access.

| Agent | Bash Expected Use | WebSearch Expected Use | Tier | Lead Stages | Support Stages | Total Stage Involvement |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| aidlc-product-agent | No | Yes | judgment | 5 | 3 | 8 |
| aidlc-design-agent | No | Yes | judgment | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| aidlc-delivery-agent | No | No | templated | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| aidlc-architect-agent | No | No | judgment | 7 | 3 | 10 |
| aidlc-aws-platform-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 2 | 5 | 7 |
| aidlc-compliance-agent | No | Yes | judgment | 0 | 4 | 4 |
| aidlc-devsecops-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 0 | 5 | 5 |
| aidlc-developer-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| aidlc-quality-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent | Yes | No | templated | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| aidlc-operations-agent | Yes | No | templated | 3 | 0 | 3 |

**Observations:**
- The aidlc-architect-agent has the broadest stage involvement (10 stages across 3 phases), reflecting its role as the central design authority.
- Across the full 14-agent roster, nine agents carry the `judgment` tier and five step down on Claude Code, Codex, and opencode (the two `balanced` reviewers plus the three `templated` planners; on Kiro, Cursor, and Copilot all tiers inherit the session model and effort, so no agent steps down there); the stepped-down agents produce reviews against explicit checklists or dominantly templated planning, CI/CD, and runbook work. The matrix above covers the 11 domain-expert agents.
- The aidlc-compliance-agent operates purely in an advisory capacity (4 support stages across Ideation, Construction, and Operation; no lead stages).
- Six of 11 agents are expected to use Bash for CLI interaction (infrastructure, security, development, testing, deployment, operations).
- Three agents are expected to use WebSearch for research tasks (product, design, compliance).
