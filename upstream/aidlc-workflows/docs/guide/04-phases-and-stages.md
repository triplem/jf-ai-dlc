# Phases and Stages

The AI-DLC lifecycle is organized into 5 phases containing 33 stages. This chapter explains each phase, lists its stages, and shows how they connect.

> **Harness note.** The methodology — the phases, stages, agents, and gates this
> guide describes — is identical on every harness. Where a mechanic differs by
> harness (how a gate renders, how a subagent is dispatched, where config lives),
> the difference is called out and tabled in your harness's chapter:
> [Running on other harnesses](harnesses/README.md). Examples here use Claude Code
> unless noted.

Phases execute sequentially. At each phase boundary (except Initialization → Ideation), a **verification gate** runs automated traceability checks to catch missing links, orphaned artifacts, or inconsistencies before downstream stages build on them.

---

## Phase 0: Initialization

**Purpose:** Bootstrap the workspace — scaffold the docs directory, detect the workspace, and initialize state. The welcome message is shown at session start via the `companyAnnouncements` entry in `settings.json` (not a stage).

Initialization stages run **automatically** without approval gates. All three execute inside a single deterministic tool call (`aidlc-utility intent-create`) that completes in well under a second.

| # | Stage | Lead | Key Artifacts | Condition |
|---|-------|------|---------------|-----------|
| 0.1 | Workspace Scaffold | orchestrator | first intent's record dir (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`) | ALWAYS |
| 0.2 | Workspace Detection | orchestrator | `aidlc-state.md` (workspace state) | ALWAYS |
| 0.3 | State Initialization | orchestrator | `aidlc-state.md`, `audit/` shards | ALWAYS |

**Execution notes:**
- All three stages run inline inside `aidlc-utility intent-create` - no LLM subagent delegation, no per-stage prompt.
- Workspace detection is a rule-based scanner (file extensions, known config filenames, package manifests).
- No user interaction is needed during this phase.

---

## Phase 1: Ideation

**Purpose:** Validate the initiative — capture intent, assess feasibility, define scope, form the team, and secure approval to proceed.

Intent Capture records the initial description, workflow-selected scope, and
used memory rules in its questions file. Claims in the intent statement and
stakeholder map carry inline source tags; both artifacts surface assumptions
and open questions. Retained assumptions require explicit confirmation before
the Product Lead reviewer and approval gate run.

## Phase 2: Inception

**Purpose:** Elaborate the requirements — analyze the codebase, elicit requirements, design architecture, decompose into units of work, and plan delivery.

| 2.1 | Reverse Engineering | aidlc-developer-agent | aidlc-architect-agent | 9 RE artifacts | Brownfield projects |
| 2.2 | Practices Discovery | aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent | aidlc-quality-agent, aidlc-developer-agent, aidlc-devsecops-agent | `team-practices.md`, `discovered-rules.md`, `evidence.md` (promoted to `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/team.md` / `project.md` on affirmation) | CONDITIONAL |
| 2.3 | Requirements Analysis | aidlc-product-agent | — | `requirements.md` | ALWAYS |
| 2.4 | User Stories | aidlc-product-agent | aidlc-design-agent, aidlc-developer-agent, aidlc-quality-agent | `stories.md`, `personas.md` | User-facing features |
| 2.5 | Refined Mockups | aidlc-design-agent | aidlc-product-agent | Hi-fi mockups, interaction spec | UI projects |
| 2.6 | Domain Design | aidlc-architect-agent | aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-design-agent | `components.md`, `decisions.md` (ADRs) | Per execution plan |
| 2.7 | Units Generation | aidlc-architect-agent | aidlc-delivery-agent | `unit-of-work.md`, `unit-of-work-dependency.md` (DAG), `unit-of-work-story-map.md` | ALWAYS |
| 2.8 | Contract Design | aidlc-architect-agent | aidlc-aws-platform-agent | `contract-summary.md` | CONDITIONAL |
| 2.9 | Delivery Planning | aidlc-delivery-agent | aidlc-architect-agent | `bolt-plan.md`, `team-allocation.md`, `risk-and-sequencing-rationale.md`, `external-dependency-map.md` | ALWAYS |

**Key behavior:** Stage 2.1 runs as a **pipeline** (2-link chain) — first an aidlc-developer-agent code scan, then an aidlc-architect-agent synthesis that writes the artifacts. Each return creates an ordered durable receipt, and multi-repo work requires one complete chain per repo before approval. It only executes for brownfield projects. Stage 2.2 runs as a **subagent hub-and-spoke** for greenfield and brownfield work: the lead drafts, quality/developer/devsecops inspect it independently, the human interview resolves gaps, and the lead integrates. Stage 2.4 runs as a **mob** — the lead drafts, and the design, developer, and quality agents contribute in parallel via contribution files.

---

## Phase 3: Construction

**Purpose:** Build the solution — design, implement, and test — in reviewable slices.

### Why Construction works the way it does

Construction used to run stage-by-stage per [unit of work](glossary.md), with an approval gate after every stage. A three-unit project meant fifteen gates before a single line of tested code shipped. Customers called it babysitting.

The first fix batched all questions, all design artifacts, then all code generation across every unit — one review at the end. That swung the pendulum the other way. A 15-unit run could land 15,000 lines of code at the build-and-test gate. Too much to verify in a single review.

The current shape is the middle path: Construction's **default walk is stage-major** — one stage runs for every Unit, then the next stage. A [Bolt](glossary.md) is the planned Construction delivery slice from 2.9 (one or more Units, DoD, confidence hypothesis, ownership). `bolt-plan.md` is planning content; the engine does not consume it for Unit grouping or walk order. Runtime batches come from `unit-of-work-dependency.md` (2.7). `Construction Iteration: unit-major` is the opt-in walk older docs described as the default. The **walking skeleton** is the planned first Bolt; under the default walk that gate is the first in-scope Construction EXECUTE stage. Once that gate approves, the **ladder prompt** fires exactly once. Your answer is recorded in state and governs the remaining Construction *stage* gates. Stages 3.6 (Build and Test) and 3.7 (CI Pipeline) run once at the end across everything.

The shape gives you an early confidence checkpoint and a deliberate autonomy choice. Reviewable delivery slices are still planned as Bolts in 2.9; the shipped walk does not yet use those slices as runtime boundaries.

### Parallel Unit batches

When two Units share their dependency prerequisite (for example, Units B and C both depend only on A) and don't depend on each other, they form a **batch**. Design stages may emit `directive.wave` for that batch. Code Generation may dispatch sibling Units concurrently. Under an autonomous swarm the engine converges every DAG batch and then presents **one** Code Generation stage gate — not one gate per intermediate batch.

```

<!-- Text fallback: The first Construction EXECUTE stage runs for every eligible Unit, then one walking-skeleton gate and the ladder prompt. Remaining design stages stay stage-major. At Code Generation, Unit A can unblock B and C so those two may run as a parallel batch. Under an autonomous swarm, one Code Generation stage gate covers the stage after the final DAG batch converges. -->

The conductor (the live `/aidlc` session) dispatches parallel Code Generation Units by issuing multiple `Task` calls in a single turn. Design stages stay on the engine-driven per-Unit (or wave) path. `BOLT_STARTED` / `BOLT_COMPLETED` fire per Unit/worktree on the swarm path; `SWARM_COMPLETED` closes the batch. A default gated run records none of those `BOLT_*` rows.

### Halt-and-ask on failure

Failures always stop Construction, even in autonomous mode. The other autonomous-stop case is the Build-and-Test loop-back's rung 4.

- If a solo Unit's Code Generation fails, Construction halts immediately and offers **retry** (re-run just that Unit), **skip** (mark it `[S]` and continue — dependents will likely also fail), or **abort**.
- If one Unit in a parallel batch fails while others succeed, the conductor waits for the whole batch to finish, preserves the successful Units' artifacts on disk, and presents the same retry / skip / abort choice for the failed Unit only.

### Stage reference

| # | Stage | Lead | Supporting | Key Artifacts | Runs |
|---|-------|------|-----------|---------------|------|
| 3.1 | Functional Design | aidlc-architect-agent | aidlc-developer-agent | `entities.md`, `rules.md`, `functional-spec.md` | Per Unit (CONDITIONAL by execution plan) |
| 3.2 | NFR Requirements | aidlc-architect-agent | aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent, aidlc-quality-agent | Performance, security, scalability, reliability, observability NFRs | Per Unit (CONDITIONAL) |
| 3.3 | NFR Design | aidlc-architect-agent | aidlc-aws-platform-agent | NFR design specifications | Per Unit (CONDITIONAL) |
| 3.4 | Infrastructure Design | aidlc-aws-platform-agent | aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent | Infrastructure specifications, IaC designs | Per Unit (CONDITIONAL) |
| 3.5 | Code Generation | aidlc-developer-agent | — | Application code + code docs | Per Unit (ALWAYS) |
| 3.6 | Build and Test | aidlc-quality-agent | aidlc-devsecops-agent | Test results, quality report | ALWAYS, once at end |
| 3.7 | CI Pipeline | aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent | — | CI config, quality gates | CONDITIONAL, once at end |

**Key behaviors:**

- Default walk is stage-major: questions and artifacts for a stage run for every Unit, then the next stage. There is no Bolt-level answers gate on the shipped walk.
- The per-Unit completion gate inside `stages/construction/code-generation.md` is **suppressed by the conductor** during normal Construction. A single stage-level gate replaces it after the last Unit settles; under swarm, that gate waits for the final DAG batch.
- The ladder prompt fires exactly once per workflow — after the first Construction EXECUTE-stage gate. Your answer is recorded as `Construction Autonomy Mode` in `aidlc-state.md` and honoured on session resume. On the default walk, `autonomous` skips remaining stage gates except halt-and-ask, the Build-and-Test loop-back's rung 4, and the swarm settle re-entry (auto-approved under autonomy). Unit-major suppresses swarm but **keeps** the per-stage gate cascade.
- Parallel Code Generation batches require multiple `Task`-capable subagent slots — see [Agents](06-agents.md) for concurrency constraints.

## Phase 4: Operation

**Purpose:** Deploy and operate — set up deployment pipelines, provision environments, configure observability, and establish feedback loops.

<!-- Text fallback: All Operation stages are CONDITIONAL. 4.1 through 4.7 flow sequentially. Stage 4.7 can either complete the workflow or loop back to start a new Ideation cycle at 1.1. -->

| # | Stage | Lead | Supporting | Key Artifacts | Condition |
|---|-------|------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 4.1 | Deployment Pipeline | aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent | — | CD config, deployment strategy, rollback runbook | CONDITIONAL |
| 4.2 | Environment Provisioning | aidlc-aws-platform-agent | aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent | Environment inventory, validation report | CONDITIONAL |
| 4.3 | Deployment Execution | aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent | aidlc-developer-agent | Deployment log, smoke tests, health checks | CONDITIONAL |
| 4.4 | Observability Setup | aidlc-operations-agent | — | Dashboards, alarms, SLO config | CONDITIONAL |
| 4.5 | Incident Response | aidlc-operations-agent | — | SSM runbooks, incident plan, escalation matrix | CONDITIONAL |
| 4.6 | Performance Validation | aidlc-quality-agent | — | Load test results, NFR validation matrix | CONDITIONAL |
| 4.7 | Feedback & Optimization | aidlc-operations-agent | aidlc-aws-platform-agent | SLO report, cost analysis, feedback loop doc | CONDITIONAL |

**Key behaviors:**
- All 7 stages are **conditional** — the entire phase may be skipped for `mvp` and `poc` scopes
- Stage 4.7 is the **terminal stage** — on approval, the workflow is complete
- The **feedback loop** from 4.7 back to 1.1 enables iterative development cycles

---

## Phase Transitions and Verification Gates

At each phase boundary (Ideation → Inception, Inception → Construction, Construction → Operation), the framework runs **phase boundary verification**. This automated check validates:

- All required artifacts from the completing phase exist
- Traceability links between artifacts are intact (e.g., every requirement maps to a story)
- No orphaned artifacts or missing references
- Consistency between related artifacts

If verification fails, the conductor reports the issues and asks whether to proceed or go back to fix them.

| Mob | 2.4 | Mid-stage judgment questions + approval gate | Lead drafts; design/developer/quality collaborate in parallel via contribution files |

Across all 33 stages, the topology count is **29 inline / 2 subagent / 1 pipeline / 1 mob**.
