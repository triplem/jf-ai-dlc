# Getting Started

This chapter walks you through installing this implementation, verifying your environment, and preparing for your first workflow.

> **Note**: This chapter's walkthrough shows **Claude Code**. AI-DLC also runs

## Prerequisites

This implementation requires two tools on your system:

| Prerequisite | Purpose | Install |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | This implementation runs as a Claude Code command. The orchestrator, agents, and hooks all execute within Claude Code. | Native install (recommended, auto-updates): macOS/Linux/WSL `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash`; Windows PowerShell `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 \| iex`. Or `brew install --cask claude-code`. ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart)) |
| **bun** | Required for all CLI tools and all 17 hooks (state management, audit logging, sensor dispatch, runtime-graph compile, loop enforcement, exact dispatch-rule delivery, state-transition, reviewer-scope, review-freeze, and plan-approval enforcement, statusline, human-turn mint, token-usage folding). Everything is TypeScript, run via bun (~20ms startup). No additional dependencies — works identically on macOS, Linux, and native Windows PowerShell. | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash` ([docs](https://bun.sh)). On Windows: `npm install -g bun` or `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 \| iex"` |

> **Important**: `bun` must be on your `PATH` for non-interactive shells. Claude Code runs your shell non-interactively, so it sources `~/.zshenv` (zsh) or `~/.bashrc` (bash) — NOT `~/.zshrc`. On Windows with Git Bash, `~/.bashrc` is the correct file. If `which bun` fails inside Claude Code, add the bun PATH export to the appropriate file.

Verify prerequisites:

```bash
command -v claude >/dev/null && echo "✓ Claude Code installed" || echo "✗ Install Claude Code first"
command -v bun    >/dev/null && echo "✓ bun installed"          || echo "✗ Install bun first"
```

## AWS Bedrock Setup

The Claude Code distribution ships configured for **AWS Bedrock**. The shipped `.claude/settings.json` sets:

### Why Claude Code ships with Bedrock by default

This rationale is specific to the Claude Code distribution. Provider setup is
harness-specific: [Codex also defaults to Bedrock](harnesses/codex-cli.md#prerequisites),
while [opencode takes its session model from global configuration but pins its
tiered personas to a Bedrock model](harnesses/opencode.md#prerequisites).

The Claude Code distribution needs a predictable runtime baseline across the
orchestrator and its tier-pinned subagents. Bedrock lets the distribution pin
exact global inference-profile IDs. Claude Code separately interprets model
context selectors such as `[1m]` and strips them before sending the model ID to
Bedrock. Together, those pins prevent a workflow from silently selecting
different model aliases or context windows on different machines. Bedrock also
uses the standard AWS SDK credential chain and IAM controls, which lets teams
manage access without committing provider keys to a project. The repository's
live Claude test environment uses the same provider and model/context baseline.

This is a distribution default, not an AI-DLC methodology requirement. AI-DLC
does not call the Bedrock API directly. To use the direct Anthropic API or
another Claude Code-supported provider:

1. In the installed `.claude/settings.json`, remove or replace
   `env.CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `env.AWS_REGION`,
   `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`,
   `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`,
   `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`,
   `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, and the top-level `model`.
2. Check `.claude/settings.local.json` and remove or replace any corresponding
   overrides there. Local settings take precedence over the shared
   `.claude/settings.json`.
3. Run `claude` and select the target provider at the login prompt. If Claude
   Code is already authenticated, run `/login` first. Complete the provider's
   authentication flow as described in the
   [Claude Code authentication guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication).

The AI-DLC stage protocol is provider-independent, but the repository ships and
tests the Bedrock model/context baseline documented below. Alternate models
still need enough context for the orchestrator and delegated agents.

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | `1` | Routes Claude Code through Bedrock |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Bedrock region — **required**; Claude Code does not read it from `~/.aws`. Override per-region (see below). |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-fable-5[1m]` | Fable alias for users who opt into `fable`/`fable[1m]` |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8[1m]` | Orchestrator model (used at `opus[1m]`, the 1M-context variant) |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]` | Subagent model |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` | Background/fast tasks (no `[1m]`: Haiku 4.5 is a 200K model with no 1M variant) |

These model pins use global Bedrock inference profile IDs (the `global.` prefix). The `[1m]` suffix on the Fable, Opus, and Sonnet pins selects the 1M-context variant — so tier-pinned subagents (not just the `opus[1m]` orchestrator) get the 1M window; Claude Code strips the suffix before the model ID reaches Bedrock. You still need to do the AWS-account-side setup once.

### One-time AWS account setup (manual path)

1. **Enable Anthropic model access.** In the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), open the **Model catalog**, select each Anthropic model you'll use (Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), and submit the use-case form. Access is granted immediately. This is required once per AWS account before any model can be invoked. (AWS Organizations can submit once from the management account; approval extends to child accounts.)

2. **Attach the IAM permissions** your role/user needs to invoke models and resolve inference profiles:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "AllowModelAndInferenceProfileAccess",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "bedrock:InvokeModel",
           "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
           "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
           "bedrock:GetInferenceProfile"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:inference-profile/*",
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:application-inference-profile/*",
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:foundation-model/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Provide AWS credentials.** Claude Code uses the default AWS SDK credential chain. Any one of:

   ```bash
   aws configure                         # static access key / secret
   # — or — an SSO profile:
   aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
   export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>
   # — or — credentials already exported in your environment (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.)
   ```

   Keep secrets out of the shared `settings.json`. Put `AWS_PROFILE` (or other env you don't want to leak) in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) instead.

4. **Set your region** if it isn't `us-east-1`. The shipped default is `us-east-1`; override it without editing shared config:

   ```bash
   cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
   # then add  "AWS_REGION": "<your-region>"  to the env block
   ```

   `settings.local.json` takes precedence over `settings.json`. Confirm the model is available in your region with `aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region <your-region>`.

> **Easier path:** instead of the manual steps above, run `claude`, choose **3rd-party platform → Amazon Bedrock** at the login prompt, and the wizard detects your credentials, region, and accessible models and writes them to your user settings. Re-run `/setup-bedrock` any time to change them. You still complete step 1 (model access) once in the console.

For the authoritative, always-current setup — IAM detail, SSO refresh, inference profiles, troubleshooting — see the AWS guide: **[Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock: Quick Setup Guide](https://community.aws/content/2tXkZKrZzlrlu0KfH8gST5Dkppq/claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock-quick-setup-guide)** and the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## MCP Servers (optional)

This implementation declares its MCP servers in `.mcp.json` at the project root (beside `.claude/`). Claude Code provisions them to the session, and every AI-DLC agent inherits all of them — so any agent can reach any declared server with no per-agent grant. The shipped `.mcp.json` declares five MCP servers:

| Server | Provides | Transport | Credentials |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `context7` | Library/SDK documentation lookups | HTTP | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` from your environment |
| `aws-mcp` | AWS API access | `uvx` (`mcp-proxy-for-aws@latest`, `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`) | Standard AWS credential chain |
| `aws-pricing` | AWS pricing queries | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-pricing-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-iac` | Infrastructure-as-code tooling | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-serverless` | Serverless tooling | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |

### Prerequisites

The four AWS servers launch through `uvx`. Install `uv`/`uvx` once:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

`context7` is an HTTP server and needs no local install. To use it, export an API key:

```bash
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

Put `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` (and any other secret env) in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) rather than the shared `settings.json`. `.mcp.json` itself carries only the env-var placeholder — no secrets are committed.

### What becomes available

The four AWS servers authenticate with the same default AWS SDK credential chain Claude Code already uses for Bedrock (see [AWS Bedrock Setup](#aws-bedrock-setup)). Once `uvx` is installed and AWS credentials resolve, those servers come up automatically; `context7` comes up once `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is set. Because the servers are inherited at the session level, every agent reaches every declared server — there is no per-agent grant to perform.

> **Restricting an agent (advanced):** inheritance is additive — declaring a server makes it available to all agents, and you cannot grant servers per-agent. To *prevent* a specific agent from using a server, narrow that agent's `tools:` allowlist to the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids it may call (a bare `mcp__<server>` token is not honoured). See [Agents](06-agents.md) for how agent tool access works.

### Not using these?

Missing credentials are not blocking. A server you have no credentials for — no AWS chain, no `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` — is simply unavailable; the workflow runs without it and never stalls waiting on it. To drop a server entirely, remove its entry from `.mcp.json`.

## Installation

AI-DLC installs by copying its distribution for your harness into your project.
Step 1 below has the copy commands for every harness; the rest of this chapter
continues on **Claude Code** (the `dist/claude/` tree, which ships as a
`.claude/` directory). On another harness, finish the install in its chapter
instead - [Running on Kiro CLI](harnesses/kiro-cli.md),
[Running on Kiro IDE](harnesses/kiro-ide.md),
[Running on Codex CLI](harnesses/codex-cli.md),
[AI-DLC on Cursor](harnesses/cursor.md),
[AI-DLC on opencode](harnesses/opencode.md), or
[AI-DLC on GitHub Copilot](harnesses/copilot.md) - each covers the prerequisites
and post-copy steps that differ.

The `cp` commands below run from a clone of this repository on the `v2`
branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows.git
cd aidlc-workflows
git checkout v2
```

### Step 1: Copy the implementation

Expand your harness:

<details open markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
cp -r dist/claude/.claude/ your-project/.claude/
cp -r dist/claude/aidlc/   your-project/aidlc/     # the workspace shell — a sibling of .claude/, not inside it
# Existing .gitignore: preserve it and merge only the section beginning "# AI-DLC".
if [ ! -e your-project/.gitignore ]; then
  cp dist/claude/.gitignore your-project/.gitignore
fi
```

The first line copies the engine — the orchestrator, stage files, agent personas, hooks, knowledge files, and default settings. The second copies the **workspace shell**: the pre-built `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` method tree the engine reads. It ships as a **sibling** of `.claude/` (not inside it), so it must be copied separately — or copy the whole `dist/claude/` tree at once. `/aidlc --doctor` fails its "workspace shell ready" check if `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` is missing.

The guarded block copies the complete starter `.gitignore` only when the project
does not already have one. Otherwise, preserve every project-owned rule and
merge only the section from `# AI-DLC` through the end of the shipped file; do
not copy its generic starter rules. Without the AI-DLC section, your first
commit picks up the per-user cursors (`aidlc/active-space`,
`aidlc/spaces/*/intents/active-intent`) and machine-local runtime
(`aidlc/.aidlc-clone-id`, `runtime-graph.json`, sensor caches,
`spaces/*/knowledge/.sources.local.json`), which the `## Git Integration`
section of the installed `.claude/CLAUDE.md` states are already excluded.

Start (or fully restart) Claude Code from the project root, approve the project hooks when prompted or through `/hooks`, then fully restart Claude Code again so the approval takes effect; `/clear` is not enough. On managed fleets, if `/hooks` says hooks are restricted by policy, follow [Claude managed policy blocks project hooks](15-troubleshooting.md#claude-managed-policy-blocks-project-hooks).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Kiro CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.kiro your-project/aidlc
cp -R dist/kiro/.kiro/. your-project/.kiro/
cp -R dist/kiro/aidlc/. your-project/aidlc/    # the workspace shell (spaces/default/memory) — a sibling of .kiro/, not inside it
cp dist/kiro/AGENTS.md your-project/AGENTS.md  # merge if you already have one
# Existing .gitignore: preserve it and merge only the section beginning "# AI-DLC".
if [ ! -e your-project/.gitignore ]; then
  cp dist/kiro/.gitignore your-project/.gitignore
fi
```

The guarded block copies the complete starter `.gitignore` only when the project
does not already have one. Otherwise, preserve every project-owned rule and
merge only the section from `# AI-DLC` through the end of the shipped file; do
not copy its generic starter rules.

Then continue in [Running AI-DLC on Kiro CLI](harnesses/kiro-cli.md): prerequisites (Kiro CLI ≥ 2.6, a paid plan for Opus 4.8) and the shipped default-agent setting.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Kiro IDE</strong></summary>

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.kiro your-project/aidlc
cp -R dist/kiro-ide/.kiro/. your-project/.kiro/
cp -R dist/kiro-ide/aidlc/. your-project/aidlc/     # the workspace shell (spaces/default/memory) — a sibling of .kiro/, not inside it
cp dist/kiro-ide/AGENTS.md your-project/AGENTS.md   # merge if you already have one
```

Then continue in [Running AI-DLC on Kiro IDE](harnesses/kiro-ide.md): prerequisites (Opus 4.8 as the chat model), the v2 hook files, and the PATH note for bun in non-interactive shells.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Codex CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
cp -r dist/codex/.codex/  your-project/.codex/
cp -r dist/codex/.agents/ your-project/.agents/
cp -r dist/codex/aidlc/   your-project/aidlc/      # the workspace shell (spaces/default/memory) — a sibling of .codex/, not inside it
cp dist/codex/AGENTS.md   your-project/AGENTS.md   # or merge into yours
```

Then continue in [AI-DLC on Codex CLI](harnesses/codex-cli.md): the project must be a **git repository**, and the install is not complete until the `.gitignore` entries and the hook trust pre-seed from that chapter are applied.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

```bash
bun dist/cursor/install.ts your-project
```

Then continue in [AI-DLC on Cursor](harnesses/cursor.md) for IDE and CLI usage, hook behavior, permissions, and installer refresh rules.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>opencode</strong></summary>

```bash
cp -r dist/opencode/.aidlc/    your-project/.aidlc/
cp -r dist/opencode/.opencode/ your-project/.opencode/
cp -r dist/opencode/aidlc/     your-project/aidlc/      # the workspace shell — a sibling of .aidlc/, not inside it
cp dist/opencode/opencode.json your-project/opencode.json  # or merge into yours
cp dist/opencode/AGENTS.md     your-project/AGENTS.md      # or merge into yours
```

Then continue in [AI-DLC on opencode](harnesses/opencode.md): the split `.aidlc/` + `.opencode/` layout, the load-bearing `opencode.json` blocks to keep when merging, and the `.gitignore` entries.

</details>

> **Upgrading an install that uses plugins:** copying a fresh
> `dist/<harness>/` engine over an existing project restores the shipped stage
> graph and core stage sources, which removes composed plugin graph entries and
> contribution merges. After every engine reinstall or upgrade, run
> `/aidlc plugin sync`. Claude, Codex, Cursor, and Kiro IDE can also self-heal
> through their plugin compose hook on the next session start; Kiro CLI requires
> the explicit sync.

### Step 2: Navigate to your project

```bash
cd your-project
```

All `/aidlc` commands run relative to the project root.

---

## The Workspace Shell

There is no scaffold step. The distribution you copied in already ships the
workspace shell — the `.claude/` engine plus a pre-built `aidlc/spaces/default/`
holding the memory layer (`aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`, where team-affirmed
practices and learnings live). You do not run any init command.

The first time you run `/aidlc` (or describe what to build), the engine
**auto-creates** the first intent into the active space. Each intent gets its own
record dir at `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`, which holds:

- `aidlc-state.md` — the per-intent workflow state
- `audit/` — the audit trail, written as per-clone shards (`<host>-<clone>.md`)
- `<phase>/<stage>/...` — the stage artifacts (e.g. `inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`)

Team knowledge lives one level up, at the space level —
`aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/` (a sibling of `intents/`) — so it accumulates
across every intent in the space. The engine creates it empty; you add free-form
files under an optional `aidlc-shared/` and per-agent subdirectories.

To add [team knowledge](08-knowledge.md) or team practices before your first run,
edit the shipped `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` files; the space-level
`aidlc/knowledge/` directory is created (empty) once your first `/aidlc` runs.

For the full picture of the workspace layout — how it holds many intents at once,
what spaces are for, and the commands to move between them — see
[Spaces and Intents](03-spaces-and-intents.md).

---

## Verify the Setup

Run the health check to confirm everything is in place:

```
/aidlc --doctor
```

`--doctor` exits 0 when every check passes and 1 when any check fails; the full report writes to stdout in both cases.

### What `--doctor` checks

| Check | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| Prerequisites | `bun` is installed and on `$PATH` |
| Hook presence | Every hook `settings.json` wires (its `hooks` blocks + the `statusLine` command — all 17 framework hooks) exists in `.claude/hooks/`; a wired-but-missing hook fails loudly. Sourcing the expected roster from `settings.json` means adding a hook there auto-checks it |
| Hooks enabled (Claude Code) | No inspected settings file globally disables hooks. Fails loudly when `"disableAllHooks": true` is resolved from enterprise managed settings (the platform file plus alphabetical `managed-settings.d/` fragments), `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.claude/settings.json`. Follows Claude Code's layer precedence, so a higher-precedence `false` suppresses a lower `true` |
| Project structure | `.claude/settings.json` exists with expected configuration |
| Workspace shell | `.claude/` + `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` are present (the shipped shell) |
| State file | the active intent's `aidlc-state.md` matches its audit trail (no drift) |
| Hook heartbeats | `.aidlc-hooks-health/` contains timestamps from hook executions; zero heartbeats fail once workflow progresses, and heartbeats more than five minutes older than the latest stage/gate event fail as stopped |
| Claude managed hook policy | On Claude Code, effective managed `allowManagedHooksOnly: true` is reported because it blocks every project hook in `.claude/settings.json`; it uses the same platform paths, fragment ordering, and `AIDLC_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH` override as the global-disable check |
| Graph integrity | No cycles in `stage-graph.json`; every slug has a matching stage file |
| Scope validation | All 11 scopes walk cleanly against the graph (advisories for scope-truncation gaps are expected) |
| Schema + references | Every stage's YAML frontmatter validates, and every consumes/requires_stage reference resolves |
| Duplicate producers | Reports consumed artifacts with multiple producers and the stage slugs involved (advisory - never fails) |
| Keyword overlap | No keyword is claimed by more than one scope across the `.claude/scopes/*.md` files |
| Plugin checks | Optional `tools/<plugin>-doctor.ts` checks from enabled plugins; error findings fail doctor, advisory findings remain visible without changing the exit code |
| Pending-compose marker | Reports a present `aidlc/.aidlc-compose-pending` (the in-flight compose gate marker) with its age. Fresh (under 24h, the normal state at an open compose gate) passes as advisory; stale (a crashed compose gate stranded it) fails. Silent when absent. Remediation: delete it if no compose gate is pending, or resolve the gate |
| Background-subagent ledger | Reports the fresh and stale entry counts in `aidlc/.aidlc-subagent-inflight`. Each accepted background dispatch adds one session-scoped entry and each completion removes one matching entry. Fresh entries (under 2h) pass as advisory; stale or malformed entries fail. Silent when absent. Remediation: delete it if no background subagent is running |

### Example output

✓ aidlc-statusline.ts present
✓ Hooks enabled (resolved disableAllHooks is not true)
✓ settings.json present
✓ AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE (unset — no project default)
✓ workspace shell ready (.claude/ + aidlc/spaces/default/memory/)
✓ Hook heartbeats: not yet fired (first workflow stage will populate)
✓ State matches last audit event (no drift)
✓ Cycle detection: 0 cycles
✓ Orphan stage files: 33 graph entries all have files
✓ Scope validation: 11 scopes valid
✓ Schema validation: 33/33 stages valid
✓ Graph references: 122 artifacts + edges resolved
✓ Duplicate producers: every consumed artifact has a single producer
✓ Keyword overlap: no conflicts
```

### Fixing failures

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `bun` not installed | Install via `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash`. On Windows: `npm install -g bun` or `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 \| iex"`. Ensure it is on PATH for non-interactive shells. |
| Hook not present | Re-copy the `.claude/` directory from the distribution |
| Hooks registered but never executed | Doctor names how many stages have progressed. Run `/hooks` to check approval and policy state; approve pending hooks and fully restart the CLI. If `/hooks` says hooks are restricted by policy, only the Claude Code administrator can lift managed `allowManagedHooksOnly`; use the two attended-session bypass variables below only as an interim. |
| `allowManagedHooksOnly=true` | Ask the Claude Code administrator to lift the setting in managed `managed-settings.json`; project settings cannot override it. For attended recovery only, launch the CLI with `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1` and `AIDLC_SKIP_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_GUARD=1`. |
| `settings.json` missing | Re-copy from the distribution: `cp dist/claude/.claude/settings.json .claude/settings.json` |
| Workspace shell missing | Re-copy the workspace shell from `dist/claude/` into your project root |
| State file issues | Archive the active intent's record dir under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/` and run `/aidlc` to start fresh |
| Graph/scope/schema/keyword failures | The diagnostic reports the specific artifact, slug, or scope name at fault. These indicate authoring drift in `.claude/aidlc-common/stages/` or `.claude/scopes/`; regenerate the compiled graph + scope grid with `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-graph.ts compile` or inspect the named stage/scope directly. |

## Start Your First Workflow

Once `--doctor` passes, you are ready to run:

```
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

Or specify a scope directly:

```
/aidlc classic
/aidlc express
/aidlc feature
/aidlc bugfix Fix the login timeout issue
```

See [Workflow Profiles](workflow-profiles.md) to choose the right lifecycle, then
[Your First Workflow](02-your-first-workflow.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough
of what happens next.

---

## Quick Reference

In your shell:

```bash
# Verify prerequisites
command -v claude >/dev/null && echo "✓ Claude Code" || echo "✗ Claude Code"
command -v bun    >/dev/null && echo "✓ bun"          || echo "✗ bun"

# From your aidlc-workflows clone (v2 branch) - see Installation above
# Install (engine + the workspace shell sibling)
cp -r dist/claude/.claude/ your-project/.claude/
cp -r dist/claude/aidlc/   your-project/aidlc/
# Existing .gitignore: preserve it and merge only the section beginning "# AI-DLC".
if [ ! -e your-project/.gitignore ]; then
  cp dist/claude/.gitignore your-project/.gitignore
fi

# Launch Claude Code in your project
cd your-project && claude
```

Inside the Claude Code session:

```
# Verify (exits 1 on any check failure; read stdout for the full report)
/aidlc --doctor

# Start
/aidlc Build a task management API with user authentication
```

---

## Tool Permissions

The included `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves Claude Code tools (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, WebSearch) so workflows run without per-call permission prompts. Review this file before use and adjust to your security requirements.

See [Customization](13-customization.md) for details on modifying tool permissions.
