// t189-compose-dispatch.sdk.test.ts - the P0 composer-dispatch beat (sdk).
//
// The deterministic half is pinned by t198 (the engine's Branch 4c emits the
// composer-dispatch print for compose/--new-scope/--report; Branch 8 emits the
// inference confirm / compose offer; classifyTerminalCommand stays null). What
// only a LIVE run can prove is the CONDUCTOR half the SKILL.md composer block
// names: on the dispatch print, the conductor Tasks the composer agent, the
// composer runs the read-only `detect` scan and returns a structured proposal,
// and the conductor renders the approve/edit/reject gate WITHOUT writing scope
// data or creating before an approval.
//
// Journey (one interactive run, stopped at the gate):
//   drive:     `/aidlc compose "<task>"` on a fresh project (no workspace).
//   engine:    Branch 4c print naming the composer agent (t198 pins the shape).
//   conductor: dispatches the composer via the Task tool; the composer runs
//              `detect --json` (its tool-result carries the scan payload);
//              the conductor surfaces an AskUserQuestion gate.
//   stop:      at the FIRST AskUserQuestion (stopAfterAskUserQuestion) - the
//              gate itself is the P0 deliverable; no write, no creation.
//
// Assertions stay at the JOURNEY level (tool results + disk), tolerant of
// conversational variance, mirroring t143/t176 - NEVER on assistantText:
//   (a) the engine emitted the composer-dispatch print (Bash tool-result
//       carrying the deterministic directive JSON);
//   (b) the composer was DISPATCHED (a Task tool call appeared) - the
//       conductor did not improvise a grid inline;
//   (c) a gate fired (askedQuestions >= 1) and the run stopped there;
//   (d) NOTHING was written: no aidlc-state.md (no creation), no composed scope
//       file in .claude/scopes/ beyond the 11 stock ones, scope-grid.json
//       still has exactly 10 keys. P0 stops at render - the write is P2.
//   (e) the composer's returned proposal carries the ARS contract: the
//       Task/Agent tool-result names the entropy components (at least CSU)
//       and the evidence method (codekb | fallback). The dispatch print and
//       SKILL.md both demand the ars block; a proposal without it means the
//       composer silently ran the old keyword flow - the exact regression a
//       live trace caught once (three-key proposal, zero ARS output).
//
// It SPENDS TOKENS - driveAidlc drives the real /aidlc on Opus/Bedrock. Gated
// on claude-CLI presence (the file calls driveAidlc(), so claude-gate.ts marks
// it SDK-dependent; the runner skips-with-reason when claude is absent).
