// t176-new-work-offer-second-intent.test.ts — the P4 OFFER beat (sdk).
//
// The deterministic half of "a second intent alongside an active one" is pinned
// by t165 (intent-create mints a 2nd record while one is active; two isolated
// rows; distinct uuids; B's creation never mutates A's shard). What was NEVER
// exercised is the CONVERSATIONAL beat the vision promised: with an intent
// already active, describing a GENUINELY NEW, UNRELATED piece of work prompts
// the orchestrator to OFFER a second intent (you confirm), rather than blindly
// advancing the active intent. RECOGNISING new-work + phrasing the offer is
// conductor PROSE (knowledge→LLM, in skills/aidlc/SKILL.md); on CONFIRM the prose
// routes through `next --new-intent`, so the read-only engine emits the SAME
// creation directive the fresh-start path does (carrying the `--label` seam) rather
// than the conductor hand-building intent-create. Either way it can only be
// verified LIVE, the way the codebase verifies every conductor behaviour: the
// Claude Agent SDK driver answering the offer Y/n on a structured callback.
//
// Journey (one interactive run):
//   seed:      ONE active intent mid-ideation (subject: a widget feature) +
//              its registry row (createTestProject's default record carries it).
//   drive:     `/aidlc "<a clearly unrelated new piece of work>"`.
//   conductor: recognises the input is NEW-WORK (not a continuation of the
//              widget intent), OFFERS a second intent via AskUserQuestion (the
//              answerScript confirms YES), then runs `intent-create` and re-enters
//              the loop — the run-then-continue shape the offer prose names.
//   disk:      the registry now carries TWO in-flight intents (the offer was
//              confirmed and the creation fired into the active space).
//
// Assertions stay at the JOURNEY level, tolerant of conversational variance,
// mirroring t143/t71 — NEVER on assistantText. The proof the OFFER (not just a
// creation) fired is the CONJUNCTION of (a)+(b)+(c), not any one alone:
//   (a) an AskUserQuestion menu was surfaced (a human-gated pause). Asked BEFORE
//       the creation, since stopAfterToolResult halts on the first creation result. NB
//       this alone is NOT proof of the offer — the seeded intent is mid-ideation
//       at a gating EXECUTE stage, so a CONTINUATION would also surface an
//       approval gate; the offer-vs-gate distinction is carried by (b)+(c).
//   (b) the conductor ACTED on the confirm — `intent-create` ran (its verbatim
//       `State initialized:` summary, emitted ONLY inside handleIntentCreate,
//       landed as a Bash tool-result; a continuation path never emits it);
//   (c) a SECOND intent exists on disk — readIntentRegistry has 2 rows.
// (b)+(c) are airtight: with an intent already active the engine advances it
// (Branch 10, !stateContent-gated creates), so a 2nd intent can ONLY arise from
// the conductor's offer→confirm→intent-create. The offer's affirmative option is
// pinned to "Yes" by the SKILL.md prose, which the answerScript keys on so the
// confirm is deterministic; a model that ignores that pin fails SAFE (the
// fallback misses → no creation → (b)+(c) RED), never a false green.
//
// It SPENDS TOKENS — driveAidlc drives the real /aidlc on Opus/Bedrock. The run
// stops the instant the creation tool-result lands (stopAfterToolResult), so no
// stage body of the new intent is executed. Gated on claude-CLI presence
// (run-tests.ts:274 — the file calls driveAidlc(), so claude-gate.ts marks it
// SDK-dependent and the runner skips-with-reason when claude is absent; never a
// hard fail).
