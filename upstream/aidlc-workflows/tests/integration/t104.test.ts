// covers: subcommand:aidlc-utility:doctor
//
// CLI-contract port of tests/integration/t104-doctor-rule-drift.sh (TAP plan 6),
// mechanism = cli. Equal-or-stronger migration: every .sh assertion that
// shelled out to `bun aidlc-utility.ts doctor --project-dir <p>` against
// AIDLC_RULES_DIR fixtures is preserved by SPAWNING the real CLI via
// node:child_process spawnSync (BUN + the tool .ts path), asserting on the
// combined stdout+stderr the tool writes (the .sh ran `2>&1 || true`) — the
// PROCESS boundary. The contract under test is the deterministic-tool half of
// T2: doctor surfaces same-`##`-heading overlap between aidlc-org.md's
// POPULATED headings and team/project(-learnings) files as an advisory `✓`
// row, quoting the org sentence inline. The contradiction VERDICT is the
// orchestrator-LLM's at observation time — doctor never blocks on it.
//
// SPAWN (not in-process): the handler is `handleDoctor(projectDir)` which
// terminates with `process.exit(failed > 0 ? 1 : 0)` (aidlc-utility.ts:1385)
// and writes its report via `process.stdout.write` (:1373). The rule-drift row
// is only observable on that stdout, and the AIDLC_RULES_DIR / AIDLC_STAGE_GRAPH
// fixture-isolation seams (aidlc-graph.ts:160-162) are evaluated inside the
// subprocess. An in-process twin would lose the env-seam isolation and the
// process.exit shell the .sh's `|| true` is written around. spawnCount = all.
//
// EXIT-CODE NOTE: the .sh runs `bun "$UTIL" doctor ... 2>&1 || true` — it
// SWALLOWS the exit code, because a bare temp project fails the hook/settings
// checks (doctor exits 1 on any failure, :1385). The rule-drift row is an
// always-`pass:true` advisory (:1239,:1268,:1276) regardless. So like the .sh
// we assert on stdout content, not on res.status — the row renders identically
// at exit 1. (We DO capture status to mirror the `|| true` semantics.)
//
// FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (mirrors the .sh's per-case mktemp -d rules dir + a fresh
// mktemp -d project with aidlc-docs/, both rm -rf'd):
//   - Each case writes its rules fixture (the relocated method files org.md /
//     team.md / project.md, neutral names) into a FRESH temp dir handed
//     to the tool via AIDLC_RULES_DIR. Byte-for-byte the .sh heredocs.
//   - The project dir is a FRESH temp dir with aidlc-docs/ (toPortablePath so
//     audit.md the tool may append round-trips on Windows). doctor reads no
//     audit.md content here — the assertion surface is stdout — but the dir
//     must exist so doctor's aidlc-docs checks don't crash, exactly as the .sh
//     did `mkdir -p "$proj/aidlc-docs"`.
//   - AIDLC_STAGE_GRAPH points at the shipped stage-graph.json (the .sh's
//     SEED_GRAPH) so the unrelated graph-backed doctor checks resolve.
//   - NOTHING is written under tests/fixtures/**; all dirs cleaned in afterAll.
//
// PARITY NOTES (every .sh `ok` line maps to an expect()-bearing test() below;
// several are STRONGER than the original grep):
//   - .sh case 1  assert_contains OUT "Rule drift: 1 team/project rule(s)
//       overlap org policy (review for contradiction)"  -> test 1: stdout
//       contains the same literal headline (N=1, team.md drift).
//   - .sh case 2  grep file + "Testing Posture" + the quoted org sentence
//       -> test 2: STRONGER — asserts the SINGLE rendered drift line carries
//       all three (file `team.md`, `## Testing Posture`, and
//       the exact org sentence) co-located, not merely present somewhere in
//       stdout.
//   - .sh case 3  DRIFT_LINE prefixed `^✓` (advisory pass)  -> test 3: the
//       grepped `Rule drift:` line starts with `✓ ` (✓ + two spaces, the
//       tool's pass prefix at :1361), proving it did NOT push `failed`.
//   - .sh case 4  N=0 fixture -> "Rule drift: no team/project rule overlaps
//       org policy" AND `^✓`  -> test 4: both, on the same grepped line.
//   - .sh case 5  org-absent fixture -> "Rule drift: org rules absent
//       (informational)"  -> test 5: stdout contains it (STRONGER: also pins
//       the `✓` advisory prefix on that line).
//   - .sh case 6  fixture isolation -> "UNIQUEFIXTURETOKEN" quoted AND
//       "Rule drift: 1 team/project rule(s) overlap org policy"  -> test 6:
//       both on the same rendered drift line (read seam honoured end-to-end).
//
// 6 .sh asserts -> 6 migrated expect()-bearing test() cases here, plus
// lifecycle triage coverage for deprecated/date-stale/live/mixed fixtures.
