// covers: scope:bugfix, scope:express, scope:feature, scope:mvp, scope:security-patch, scope:infra, scope:refactor
//
// CLI-contract port of tests/integration/t130-scope-runners.sh (TAP plan 12),
// mechanism = cli. The .sh carried NO `# covers:` header (it predates the
// covers-registry convention); its SUBJECT is the per-scope first-EXECUTE-stage
// routing the scope runners drive through the engine. So this twin credits the
// `scope:` units it genuinely proves — the same units the .sh exercised by
// initialising under each scope and resolving its opening move. (Confirmed valid
// scope unitIds in tests/.coverage-registry.json: all enumerate from
// data/scope-grid.json.)
//
// COVERAGE EXTENSION (the post-MR11 delivery audit, §6/§7): the .sh proved the
// four first-BATCH scopes; the same engine drive trivially extends to the two
// remaining scopes the audit flagged UNCOVERED — infra and refactor — by adding
// their measured first-EXECUTE move to the CASES table below. Each is the
// identical assertion shape (run-stage + first-EXECUTE stage + baked persona)
// over the same real `aidlc-orchestrate next --scope <s>` drive, so it covers
// the scope at the same cli strength, not by a weaker mention. enterprise/poc/
// classic is covered by its own tui scope run-through; bugfix/express/feature/
// mvp/security-patch/infra/refactor are the cli-routed set this corpus owns.
//
// WHAT THE .sh PROVED (t130-scope-runners.sh:1-12 prose + the loop at :42-70):
//   For each first-batch scope the runner's shell makes the SAME first move —
//   `aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --scope <scope>` over a real init,
//   and the test pins that
//     (a) the engine resolves a `run-stage` directive,
//     (b) it lands on that scope's first EXECUTE stage (the brownfield
//         conditional stages SKIP on an empty greenfield workspace, so
//         security-patch's reverse-engineering is greenfield-skipped and the
//         engine lands on requirements-analysis), and
//     (c) the directive carries the conductor persona — decision D-E: the runner
//         does NOT load the persona by hand; the ENGINE bakes it into the FIRST
//         run-stage of the workflow.
//   The exhaustive drive-to-done per scope is t118's corpus; t130 pins only that
//   the runner's baked-scope FIRST move reaches the engine and carries the persona.
//
// WHY SPAWN (mechanism cli, not in-process): the .sh shells out to TWO binaries
// per case — `aidlc-utility.ts init --scope …` (a state-writing
// MUTATION) then `aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --scope … ` (the engine's read-only
// directive emit) — against a temp project holding a FULL copy of the shipped
// .claude/. Both run FROM THE COPY (`bun <proj>/.claude/tools/…`) so the engine
// resolves the graph, the stage files, AND `../aidlc-common/conductor.md`
// (aidlc-orchestrate.ts:351, CONDUCTOR_PERSONA_PATH resolved relative to the
// tool module) from the copied tree. An in-process twin would lose the init→next
// process seam AND the cwd-independent persona resolution the corpus exists to
// pin. spawnCount = all (init + next per scope).
//
// SOURCE UNDER TEST:
//   - aidlc-orchestrate.ts buildRunStageDirective (:742) — kind:"run-stage",
//     stage = resolved graph node slug; bakes conductor_persona on the FIRST
//     run-stage (isFirstRunStageOfWorkflow, :385 -> readConductorPersona, :357).
//   - The per-scope first-EXECUTE-stage routing the engine derives from the
//     compiled scope grid (verified live: bugfix->requirements-analysis,
//     feature->intent-capture, mvp->intent-capture, security-patch->
//     requirements-analysis).
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1; the .sh emitted 3 `ok` lines per scope ->
// each is one expect() here, grouped under one test() per scope = STRONGER:
// kind + stage + persona asserted together on the SAME parsed directive object,
// not three independent greps; the .sh's plan 12 = 4 scopes x 3 assertions, this
// twin extends to 6 scopes x 3 = 18 with the two audit-flagged scopes added):
//   .sh "aidlc-<scope>: baked-scope first move -> run-stage"            -> directive.kind === "run-stage"
//   .sh "aidlc-<scope>: lands on first EXECUTE stage (<want>)"          -> directive.stage === <want>
//   .sh "aidlc-<scope>: directive carries the conductor persona"        -> typeof directive.conductor_persona === "string" && length > 0
//
// FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (mirrors the .sh's make_project at :32-40 — mktemp -d,
// cp -r "$SRC" "$proj/.claude", init --scope <s>, then rm -rf): each
// scope gets a FRESH integration project (setupIntegrationProject copies the
// shipped dist/claude/.claude into <proj>/.claude exactly as the .sh's cp -r),
// is initialised via the COPIED utility tool, then the COPIED engine
// resolves `next --scope <s>`. Nothing is written under tests/fixtures/**; all
// temp dirs cleaned in afterAll.
