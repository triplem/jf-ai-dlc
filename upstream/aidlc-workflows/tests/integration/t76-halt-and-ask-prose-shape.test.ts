//
// t76 — halt-and-ask prose-shape contract across the worktree-dispatch surfaces.
// Migrated from tests/integration/t76-halt-and-ask-prose-shape.sh (TAP plan 7).
// The .sh had no `# covers:` header; its subject is the prose shape of three
// SHIPPED markdown artefacts, so the covers ids are `doc:<relative-path>` for
// each. There is no tool/function under test — the bytes on disk ARE the
// contract.
//
// Mechanism: none. The .sh ran a battery of `assert_grep` plus three
// `grep -n | head -1` line-extraction + same-line `grep -q` checks against the
// bytes on disk (NOT file-wide greps — the line-anchoring is load-bearing so a
// "preserved" word elsewhere in the file can't false-green). The TS twin reads
// those same bytes ONCE in-process and asserts the same patterns — zero spawn,
// zero LLM, zero tokens, no process boundary. STRONGER than the .sh: the three
// same-line cases are reproduced by isolating the matched line and asserting the
// phrase is co-located on THAT line (exactly what the .sh's grep-extract-then-
// grep-the-line did), rather than a file-wide contains().
//
// Engine-cutover note (verbatim from the .sh header): the original SKILL.md half
// of this contract (slug-derivation paragraph, two worktree-dispatch carve-out
// subheadings, "Inspecting a paused Bolt" paragraph, PR-13 prefix-hash +
// orphan-BOLT_STARTED italic carve-outs — formerly tests 1-5, 13-14) was RETIRED
// at the engine cutover; that prose moved into the engine, covered by the t118
// corpus. The halt-and-ask PROSE-SHAPE contract still lives in the three
// downstream surfaces this test pins.
//
// Source under test (read verbatim, byte cites against the files as shipped):
//   dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md
//     :140 AUQ template question interpolates [path] AND [branch_name]:
//          'Worktree at [path] on branch [branch_name]. How would you like to proceed?'
//     :145 Skip option description carries "worktree preserved"
//     :132 "- Skip:" bullet carries "Worktree at" SAME-LINE (preservation phrase)

//   dist/claude/.claude/agents/aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent.md
//     :63  "On conflict envelopes" bullet appends "preserves the worktree" SAME-LINE
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1 — every one of the 7 .sh assertions maps to a
// named test(); the three same-line cases are STRONGER, asserting co-location on
// the matched line rather than file-wide presence):
//   .sh 1 (PROTO question [path]+[branch_name])        -> "AUQ question carries [path] and [branch_name]"
//   .sh 2 (PROTO Skip.*worktree preserved)             -> "Skip option mentions worktree preserved"
//   .sh 3 (PROTO ^- Skip: line + Worktree at same-line)-> "- Skip: bullet carries preservation phrase same-line"
//   .sh 4 (PROTO ^- Abort: line + Worktree at same-line)-> "- Abort: bullet carries preservation phrase same-line"
//   .sh 5 (BRANCH Dirty-tree line + Worktree preserved on retry same-line) -> "Dirty-tree bullet appends preservation phrase same-line"
//   .sh 6 (BRANCH construction module.*Halt-and-ask)   -> "cross-links to construction protocol halt-and-ask block"
//   .sh 7 (PDAGENT On conflict envelopes line + preserves the worktree same-line) -> "conflict bullet appends preservation phrase same-line"
