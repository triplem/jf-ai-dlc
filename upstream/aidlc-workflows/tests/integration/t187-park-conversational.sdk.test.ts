//
// t187 - park + conversational carve-out (live SDK). The shipped end-to-end
// proof of the #365 / #366 / #367 park umbrella: drive a REAL agent through the
// Claude Agent SDK against the shipped dist and confirm a conductor that is
// asked to PAUSE the workflow for later parks it cleanly and ends its turn,
// instead of rubber-stamping the remaining stages to escape the forwarding-loop
// Stop hook.
//
// WHY a live test in addition to t122's deterministic e2e: t122 case (9) pins
// the REAL engine + REAL hook park transition with NO model in the loop (it
// spawns `aidlc-orchestrate park` by hand, then feeds the real hook). This pins
// the OTHER half: that a real conductor, told "pause this and resume later",
// actually REACHES for park (rather than batch-completing stages) and that the
// Stop hook then lets the turn end. The behavior under test is the conductor's
// CHOICE plus the hook's terminal `parked` allow, observed end to end.
//
// THE FIXTURE: state-final-stage.md seeded into the active intent's record, a
// Running workflow whose single remaining stage feedback-optimization is at [-]
// in-progress. On this exact fixture a plain `next` returns a PENDING run-stage
// (t122 case 4 proves the hook BLOCKS without a carve-out), so the only clean
// way to end the turn is `park`. That makes "the run ended cleanly" a real
// signal: if the conductor had merely quit, the hook would have re-fed the loop.
//
// HARNESS / GUARDED-ASSERTION NOTE (mirrors t122 case 3's GUARDED note and t183):
// the Stop hook firing under the headless SDK is non-deterministic (it may not
// fire on every run), so we do NOT assert on a hook block/allow event directly.
// Instead we assert on the OBSERVABLE on-disk + tool-output outcome of a park,
// which is stable whenever the conductor parks at all:
//   1. the conductor invoked park (a Bash toolResult whose input.command names
//      `aidlc-orchestrate.ts park`, OR a tool_result carrying a `parked`
//      directive / a WORKFLOW_PARKED audit row),
//   2. the state file gained Parked / Parked At Stage runtime markers,
//   3. NO new stage checkbox flipped to [x] (feedback-optimization is still [-]:
//      parking is an inter-stage pause, never a stage completion; the #367
//      rubber-stamp escape would have flipped it), and
//   4. the run ended cleanly (resultEvent is defined and not is_error), i.e. the
//      hook ALLOWED the turn to end rather than trapping it.
// We assert on toolResults (verbatim tool stdout) + resultEvent + on-disk state,
// NEVER on assistantText (the LLM's reworded prose). The driver writes an ndjson
// trace to tests/logs/<stamp>/sdk-drive-<pid>.ndjson when AIDLC_TEST_DEBUG=true.
//
// It SPENDS TOKENS: driveAidlc drives the real conductor on Opus/Bedrock. Gated
// PURELY on the claude CLI (calling driveAidlc marks the file SDK-dependent via
// claude-gate.ts; the runner skips-with-reason when claude is absent, never a
// hard fail). LIVE-SDK tier: runs on the integration tier behind the claude
// gate, NOT the fast deterministic tier.
