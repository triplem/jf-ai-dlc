// t41 — SKILL.md forwarding-loop contract + stage-graph data table.
// Migrated from tests/integration/t41-jump-flag-validation.sh (TAP plan 15, all
// assert_grep / assert_not_grep against the shipped SKILL.md).
//
// Mechanism: none. The subject is a STATIC shipped file — the orchestrator
// SKILL.md (dist/claude/.claude/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md). The .sh did 15
// grep / grep -v assertions against its bytes; the equal-or-stronger TS twin
// reads the SAME file in-process (via AIDLC_SRC from tests/harness/fixtures.ts,
// the TS port of fixtures.sh's $AIDLC_SRC) and asserts on its content. No
// spawn, no LLM, no tokens — a structural file-content contract.
//
// Subject / history (verbatim from the .sh header, t41:2-22):
//   This is the ENGINE-CUTOVER REWRITE of t41. It formerly validated the prose
//   orchestrator's flag-handling HANDLER STRUCTURE. At the cutover that entire
//   dispatch surface moved into the deterministic orchestration engine
//   (aidlc-orchestrate.ts), so t41 flipped: it now asserts the cutover's
//   SKILL.md contract — the forwarding loop is PRESENT, flag handling is
//   DELEGATED to the engine (the dispatch prose is GONE), and the two
//   human-readable data tables (scope-table + stage-graph) survive. The
//   positive flag-dispatch behaviours that USED to live here are now pinned by
//   the engine's own tests (t114-orchestrate-next, t118-engine-differential).
//
// Source under test (read directly):
//   dist/claude/.claude/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md — the /aidlc orchestrator prose.
//     - the forwarding loop invokes aidlc-orchestrate (engine), calling its
//       `next` and `report` subcommands and acting on the emitted `directive`.
//     - the prose flag-dispatch handlers (Composable Flag Extraction, prose
//       jump-direction "FORWARD JUMP", the Unknown-depth / Unknown-test-strategy
//       / mutual-exclusivity error wordings) are ABSENT — the engine owns them.
//     - a run-stage directive still branches on its `gate` (the §13 ritual seam).
//     - the stage-graph data table (mirrored from data/stage-graph.json) survives
//       the cutover: 5 representative slugs verified.
//
// Test-design note (house style): assert the OBSERVABLE contract the .sh
// asserted — presence/absence of literal strings in the shipped SKILL.md.
// Each assertion hard-codes the expected literal independently of the source.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, no guarantee dropped, several STRONGER):
//   .sh test 1  (grep 'aidlc-orchestrate')               -> "loop invokes the orchestration engine (aidlc-orchestrate)"
//   .sh test 2  (grep 'aidlc-orchestrate.ts next')       -> "loop calls the engine's next subcommand"
//   .sh test 3  (grep 'aidlc-orchestrate.ts report')     -> "loop calls the engine's report subcommand"
//   .sh test 4  (grep 'directive')                       -> "loop acts on the engine's directive"
//   .sh test 5  (grep -v 'Composable Flag Extraction')   -> "no prose Composable Flag Extraction handler"
//   .sh test 6  (grep -v 'FORWARD JUMP')                 -> "no prose jump-direction computation"
//   .sh test 7  (grep -v 'Unknown depth')                -> "no invalid-depth error wording"
//   .sh test 8  (grep -v 'Unknown test strategy')        -> "no invalid-test-strategy error wording"
//   .sh test 9  (grep -v 'Cannot use --stage and --phase together') -> "no mutual-exclusivity error wording"
//   .sh test 10 (grep 'gate')                            -> "documents branching a run-stage on its gate"
//   .sh test 11-15 (grep <slug> x5)                      -> "stage-graph table includes slug: <slug>" x5
