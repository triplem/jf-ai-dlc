.SYNOPSIS
  Run one (or all) AI-DLC `e2e` level test(s) on Windows with the documented
  environment  -  the like-for-like-with-a-user run recipe.

.DESCRIPTION
  Sets only the environment the framework + harness actually require on Windows
  (docs/guide/01-getting-started.md prerequisites + docs/reference/09-testing.md e2e
  mechanism), then invokes `bun test` on the chosen file. The driver itself spawns
  under node on Windows (node-pty wedges under bun, #748) via the AIDLC_NODE_BIN the
  test reads; bun is only the test runner.

  Deliberately does NOT set NODE_PATH. node-pty + @xterm/headless are resolved from the
  project's own node_modules (populated by setup.ps1 / `npm install`) by walking up
  from tests/harness/tui-drive.ts. NODE_PATH is what bit a prior session; its absence
  here is intentional and load-bearing.

.PARAMETER Test
  A test selector. Either a bare token (e.g. "t27" -> the matching tests/e2e file),
  or a full relative path under tests/e2e. Default "preflight" (no Bedrock tokens).

.PARAMETER ProjectDir
  The synced project tree. Default C:\aidlc.

.PARAMETER TimeoutS
  AIDLC_TEST_TIMEOUT (seconds)  -  the hang-backstop the tests read, NOT a budget.
  Default 900.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\harness\windows\run.ps1 -Test t27
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\harness\windows\run.ps1 -Test preflight
