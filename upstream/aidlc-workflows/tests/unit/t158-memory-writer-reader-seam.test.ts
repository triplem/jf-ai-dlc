// t158 — memory writer/reader ROUND-TRIP (P6 closed the P5 seam).
//
// P5 relocated the METHOD reader: loadRules()/rulesDir() now read the workspace
// tree aidlc/spaces/default/memory/ (neutral names org/team/project.md). In
// Stage A the learnings WRITER (aidlc-learnings.ts learningsFilePath() →
// persist) still targeted the OLD harness rule dir, so a confirmed learning
// landed where the relocated reader could no longer see it — a SILENT LOSS.
// This file was a `test.failing` tripwire guarding that window.
//
// P6 closed the seam: a confirmed learning IS a practice (vision §6) — persist
// now appends a practice line under the routed heading in the relocated
// {project,team}.md (via memoryDirFor(), the SAME MEMORY_SEGMENTS loadRules()
// reads from), and the `*-learnings.md` slots + fractional tiers are gone. The
// tripwire is therefore CONVERTED to a normal passing write→read round-trip:
// persist a team-scoped learning → the resolver (loadRules, pointed at the
// relocated memory dir) sees the practice line under its heading.
//
// Mechanism: cli (spawnSync of the shipped aidlc-learnings.ts persist) +
// in-process import of memoryDirFor (the reader-root oracle) + loadRules (the
// resolver). No LLM.
