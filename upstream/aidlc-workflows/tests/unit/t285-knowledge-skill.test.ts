//
// t285 - the aidlc-knowledge SKILL.md: shipped to every harness, and its prose
// kept in lockstep with the tool's real flag surface (I33, I41).
//
// Mechanism: the real committed dist/ trees + the real shipped tool. The skill is
// prose an LLM executes, so the only meaningful subject is the BYTES THAT SHIP,
// not the authored source: core/ and dist/ can disagree, and it is dist/ the user
// installs.
//
// WHY THE PARITY CHECK IS BIDIRECTIONAL AND DERIVED, not a list in this file.
// The skill's prose tells an LLM which flags to pass, which makes it load-bearing
// code with no compiler. Two distinct failures, so two directions:
//
//   skill -> tool   the skill documents a flag the tool does not accept. The LLM
//                   passes it, the tool exits non-zero, and the workflow stalls on
//                   a flag that never existed.
//   tool -> skill   the tool needs a flag the skill never mentions. The capability
//                   ships dark: nothing is broken, so nothing complains, and the
//                   feature is simply never used.
//
// Both sets are EXTRACTED from the files at run time. A hardcoded expectation here
// would only prove this file agrees with itself -- the circularity that hid two
// real schema bugs behind 48 green tests earlier in this build.
//
// The all-harness sweep is the other half. Codex and Copilot do NOT enumerate core/skills/
// (each carries a hardcoded array in its emit.ts), so a skill can pass
// every claude-tree assertion while being absent from exactly one harness. The
// registration seams are asymmetric, so the test walks EVERY root in harness/.
//
// Path references are RESOLVED, not string-matched: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}` renders to a
// different prefix per harness, and a token that substitutes to a path which does
// not exist is the trap that nearly produced a false finding in #660 round 7.
