// Pins the adversarial review contract (reviewer-as-verifier, 2.4.0) in the
// three authored surfaces that carry it:
//   - core/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a step 2 (the shared
//     contract - written once so any future reviewer inherits it)
//   - core/agents/aidlc-product-lead-agent.md (domain-voiced restatement)
//   - core/agents/aidlc-architecture-reviewer-agent.md (domain-voiced restatement)
// plus the shipped dist/claude projection of the protocol (the other dist
// trees are byte-parity-guarded by `package.ts --check`, so one projection
// pin suffices).
//
// Mechanism = none: pure text invariants over files already on disk, exactly
// like t68's metadata greps. A refactor that rewords the contract should
// update these pins deliberately, not silently drop the posture.
