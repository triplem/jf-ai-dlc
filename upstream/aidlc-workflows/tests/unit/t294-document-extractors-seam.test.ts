// covers: function:documentExtractors function:DocumentExtractorSpec
//
// t294 - the `documentExtractors` configuration seam: a team commits its text
// extractor choice so it travels to every clone.
//
// Mechanism: real filesystem + real `bun scripts/package.ts` runs (the seam IS
// the packager; a mocked writer would prove nothing about what ships).
//
// WHY THIS IS PACKAGER-OWNED, which is the whole reason the story exists.
// `harness.json` is generated AND committed AND byte-diffed by
// `package.ts --check`. Its writer builds a FRESH object, so a hand-added field
// is erased on the next build -- and fails the drift guard in the meantime. The
// runtime READER tolerating unknown keys is not evidence to the contrary: the
// reader is not what decides what ships. Three cases, and only two work:
//
//   packager-owned    add it to the manifest type + writeHarnessData; ships
//                     (absent by default) in every tree. THIS.
//   runtime-owned     written by a tool through the read-modify-write helper.
//                     Works mechanically, but that helper targets a DIFFERENT,
//                     install-local file -- so the value never reaches a clone,
//                     which is the actual requirement.
//   hand-edited       breaks --check AND is erased on the next build.
//
// The last two assertions in the first block are the ones that make this real:
// the field must be ABSENT by default in EVERY tree (so no harness is
// perturbed), and a hand-added field must FAIL `--check` (so the guard is
// measured rather than assumed). HARNESSES is enumerated rather than counted: a
// new harness must be added here, and adding one is how `copilot` was found to be
// missing the skill entirely.
