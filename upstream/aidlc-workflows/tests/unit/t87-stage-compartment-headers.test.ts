//
// t87 — shipped stage-file COMPARTMENT-HEADER contract. Migrated from
// tests/unit/t87-stage-compartment-headers.sh (TAP plan 64 — 2 distinct
// assertions per stage file across the 32 stages under aidlc-common/stages/).
// The .sh resolved STAGES_DIR = $AIDLC_SRC/aidlc-common/stages and, for every
// *.md in every phase subdir, asserted that BOTH a "## Sensors" and a
// "## Learn" H2 heading appear OUTSIDE fenced code blocks. (The .sh's header
// line called these "compartments"; a heading inside a triple-backtick fence
// is documentation, not a real compartment.)
//
// Mechanism: none. This is a pure structural check over the shipped bytes —
// does each stage file expose its two required compartment headings? No process
// boundary, no argv/exit/stdout seam, no LLM, zero tokens. We resolve the same
// tree the .sh resolved (AIDLC_SRC = <repo>/dist/claude/.claude, fixtures.ts:42)
// and read each .md in-process.
//
// The .sh has NO "# covers:" header (line 2 is a plain description). The covers
// ids above are therefore derived from the SUBJECT it inspects — the 32 shipped
// stage .md files — using the same "file:<path-under-dist/claude/.claude>"
// form the sibling structural twins use (t01-file-structure.test.ts,
// t04-agent-frontmatter.test.ts). The registry joins on these ids.
//
// Subject under test (dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/<slug>.md):
//   - Each stage file MUST contain a line that is EXACTLY "## Sensors", outside
//     any triple-backtick fenced code block (the Sensors compartment — where the
//     stage declares its "sensors:" bindings narrative).
//   - Each stage file MUST contain a line that is EXACTLY "## Learn", outside
//     any triple-backtick fenced code block (the Learn compartment — §13
//     learnings capture).
//
// Faithful port of the .sh's fence-aware awk walker (t87.sh:15-22):
//   the awk program flips a "fenced" flag on every line that starts with the
//   triple-backtick fence and skips it; otherwise, when NOT fenced and the whole
//   line equals the target heading, it records a hit and exits 0 (else exits 1).
// The walker toggles "fenced" at every fence-prefixed line and only matches the
// heading when NOT inside a fence. The match is the WHOLE-LINE equality (awk's
// $0 == h, anchored both ends), so "## Sensors and more" would not satisfy it.
// headingOutsideFence() below reimplements that exactly — STRONGER than a bare
// grep "^## Sensors" because (a) it honours the fence guard and (b) it requires
// the line to equal the heading, not merely start with it.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (the .sh emitted 2 "ok" lines PER stage in a single
// nested loop — 2 × 32 = 64. Here each of the 2 invariants is one test() that
// asserts across ALL 32 stages via a block-scoped expect() per stage, so every
// one of the 64 .sh rows maps to a named expect(). The final test re-counts to
// pin the plan):
//   .sh L29-34 (## Sensors compartment present, outside fence) -> "every stage has a ## Sensors compartment heading (outside fenced code)" [32 expects]
//   .sh L36-41 (## Learn compartment present, outside fence)   -> "every stage has a ## Learn compartment heading (outside fenced code)"   [32 expects]
//   .sh L10    plan 64                                          -> "covers EXACTLY 32 stages × 2 compartments = 64 assertions (TAP plan parity)"
