// t15 — knowledge-file inventory + non-emptiness invariant. Migrated from
// tests/unit/t15-knowledge-file-inventory.sh (the .sh declared no `# covers:`
// header; these file: ids name the shipped knowledge tree the .sh inventoried).
//
// The .sh resolved KNOWLEDGE_DIR = $AIDLC_SRC/knowledge and made a dynamic
// TAP plan of `11 (per-agent existence) + 11 (per-agent counts) + 7 (shared
// specific files) + TOTAL_FILES (every .md non-empty)`. TOTAL_FILES is
// `find KNOWLEDGE_DIR -name '*.md' -type f | wc -l`, measured = 56 this session,
// so the .sh plan = 11 + 11 + 7 + 56 = 85.
//
// Mechanism: none. This is a pure structural / on-disk check — directory
// membership, file counts, and file sizes under the distributable knowledge/
// tree. No process boundary, no argv/exit/stdout seam, no LLM, zero tokens. We
// resolve the same tree the .sh resolved via the harness's AIDLC_SRC
// (= <repo>/dist/claude/.claude, fixtures.ts:42) — the TS canonical for the
// .sh's KNOWLEDGE_DIR=$AIDLC_SRC/knowledge — and assert in-process with
// existsSync / statSync / a recursive .md walk.
//
// Subject under test: the shipped knowledge/ corpus of dist/claude/.claude/ —
// per-agent knowledge dirs + the cross-agent aidlc-shared/ set. Counts and
// shared filenames verified present on disk this session against the worktree
// dist tree.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, every .sh assertion preserved; counts are
// EQUAL-OR-STRONGER):
//   .sh L20-23  11x assert_gt count 0 (each agent dir non-empty)
//        -> "each of the 11 agent knowledge dirs has at least one .md file"
//   .sh L29-39  11x assert_eq exact per-agent count (6/4/1/3/5/6/4/4/3/7/4)
//        -> "each agent dir ships EXACTLY its expected .md count" (per-agent block-scoped)
//   .sh L45-47  7x assert_file_exists aidlc-shared/<f>
//        -> "ships each of the 7 named aidlc-shared/ files"
//   .sh L53-57  TOTAL_FILES x assert_gt size 0 (every shipped .md non-empty)
//        -> "every shipped knowledge .md file is non-empty (byte size > 0)"
//   .sh L11-14  plan = 11 + 11 + 7 + TOTAL_FILES   (dynamic TAP plan)
//        -> "TAP-plan parity: 11 + 11 + 7 + TOTAL == 85 with TOTAL == 56"
//           (re-derives the plan arithmetic from the live tree, pinning both the
//            total .md count and the summed plan the .sh computed)
//
// STRENGTHENINGS over the .sh:
//   - the per-agent count test also pins that knowledge/ holds EXACTLY the 11
//     expected agent dirs (no 12th agent dir sneaking in), which the .sh's
//     fixed AGENT_NAMES loop never checked.
//   - the non-empty test re-walks the tree and pins the walked count == 56,
//     so a dropped file cannot silently shrink the surface the .sh enforced.
