//
// t154 — codekb promotion. Deterministic, no-LLM, zero-token structural
// contract over the SHIPPED stage files: P0 promoted the reverse-engineering
// stage's outputs from the buried per-workflow path
// `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/` to the durable per-repo code
// knowledge base, and re-pointed its verified downstream consumers to read from
// the new location. The codekb-determinism placement fix then made that store
// SPACE-SCOPED — `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` (a sibling of
// intents/), the dir the `codekb-path` tool resolves — so the prose now names
// the space-level literal and the bare `aidlc/codekb/<repo>/` form is gone.
//
// Mechanism: none. We read the shipped dist/claude stage .md files in-process
// (the same AIDLC_SRC tree t05/t87 resolve) and parse frontmatter via the
// public parseStageFrontmatter (aidlc-lib.ts:1161). No process boundary, no
// argv/exit/stdout seam, no live agent. The runtime artifact-path RESOLVER
// (aidlc-orchestrate.ts resolveArtifactPath/resolveConsumePath) is a SEPARATE
// concern owned by P1 and is NOT exercised here — at P0 the change lives at the
// stage-document layer (where the RE agent reads its write destination and the
// consumers read their upstream path).
//
// CONTRACT under test (path literal = `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`):
//   1. RE stage `outputs:` names the space-level codekb path and KEEPS its 9 .md
//      artifact filenames (the filenames `aidlc-validate outputs` cross-checks
//      against the body prose, aidlc-validate.ts:51-94 — t45's invariant).
//   2. RE stage body prose writes its artifacts to the space-level codekb path.
//   3. The freshness/staleness marker `reverse-engineering-timestamp` is
//      preserved in `produces:` (the marker a shared per-repo codekb needs;
//      vision §7) and the `condition` still names "rerun for freshness".
//   4. The TWO frontmatter consumers still declare the `reverse-engineering`
//      dependency edge under `requires_stage:` (the edge is untouched — only
//      the read PATH moved), and requirements-analysis's RE-read prose points
//      at the space-level codekb path. (practices-discovery references RE
//      artifacts BY NAME, not by output path — it carries no RE output-path
//      prose to re-point, so only its `requires_stage:` edge is asserted.)
//   5. The TWO prose consumers (user-stories, nfr-requirements) point their
//      RE-read prose at the space-level codekb path.
//   6. NO stage file retains the old RE output directory literal
//      `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/` NOR the bare
//      `aidlc/codekb/<repo>/` form anywhere.
