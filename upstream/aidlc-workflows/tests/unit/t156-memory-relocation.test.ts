// covers: function:loadRules
//
// t156 — the method ("memory") relocation + per-harness native include (P5).
//
// WHAT. The AIDLC method (the layered practice files org/team/project + the
// per-phase phases/<phase>.md) relocated OUT of the per-harness rule dir
// (.claude/rules / .kiro/steering / .codex/aidlc-rules, all carrying aidlc-*.md
// names) to ONE hand-editable source of truth at the workspace root —
// aidlc/spaces/default/memory/ — with neutral filenames. Each harness reads it
// by its OWN native include (no copy, no drift):
//   - Claude  → .claude/rules/aidlc.md @-import stub → @../../aidlc/spaces/
//               default/memory/<file> (explicit @-lines; Claude @-imports do
//               NOT glob — verified against code.claude.com/docs memory.md).
//   - Kiro    → agent JSON resources glob file://aidlc/spaces/default/memory/**/*.md
//   - Codex   → AGENTS.md auto-merge + AIDLC_RULES_DIR seam + orchestrator
//               @-mention (the static seam is asserted here; the LIVE @-mention
//               probe lives in the gated e2e tests/e2e/
//               t-exec-codex-memory-include.serial.test.ts — green 2026-06-24).
//
// Three contracts land here:
//   (1) RESOLVER reads the renamed source + tolerates empty team/project stubs
//       (in-process loadRules via the AIDLC_RULES_DIR seam against a fixture
//       laid out as the relocated tree: org/team/project.md + phases/<p>.md).
//   (2) 3-WAY native-include resolution in the shipped dist trees: the Claude
//       @-stub resolves the relocated path (packaging/parity); the Kiro globs
//       point at the active space; the Codex static seam is wired
//       (AIDLC_RULES_DIR + AGENTS.md). The Codex LIVE @-mention probe is the
//       gated e2e t-exec-codex-memory-include.serial.test.ts (no token probe
//       here — unit tier stays zero-LLM).
//   (3) THE ONE-COPY INVARIANT: exactly one HAND-EDITABLE rule copy exists
//       (core/memory/), and no second hand-editable copy lives under a harness
//       rule dir. The dist copies are GENERATED (drift-guarded by package.ts
//       --check), not hand-editable, so they are excluded.
//
// Mechanism: none for (1) (in-process pure-function call via the documented
// env seam); file-inspection over the committed dist trees for (2)/(3). No LLM,
// no subprocess (the grep in (3) is a git ls over the repo). Zero tokens.
