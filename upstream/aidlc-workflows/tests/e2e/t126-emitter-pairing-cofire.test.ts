// covers: audit:WORKFLOW_STARTED, audit:PHASE_STARTED, audit:STAGE_STARTED, audit:GATE_APPROVED, audit:STAGE_COMPLETED
//
// COVERAGE NOTE: this test UNCONDITIONALLY proves all five events above are
// present in a real run. WORKFLOW_STARTED and GATE_APPROVED are asserted present
// outright (the vacuous-pass guards, assertAuditEvent below); the co-fire loop
// then asserts WORKFLOW_STARTED's partners (PHASE_STARTED + STAGE_STARTED) and
// GATE_APPROVED's partner (STAGE_COMPLETED) — so each is proven present, not
// merely conditionally. WORKFLOW_COMPLETED / PHASE_COMPLETED are NOT claimed:
// their pair antecedent (PHASE_COMPLETED) is checked only IF present, so the
// claim would be conditional on an unguaranteed event — the co-fire INVARIANT
// still holds for them, but the coverage CLAIM stays honest to what is proven.
//
// t126-emitter-pairing-cofire.test.ts — METAMORPHIC INVARIANT (§5-D, Phase 4):
// emitter-pairing co-fire. Drive a REAL `/aidlc <scope>` workflow
// through the Claude Agent SDK (driveAidlc) and assert, as data over the audit
// log, that every audit event whose taxonomy declares a co-emission PARTNER has
// that partner present in the SAME run. {sdk} mechanism (no rendering — the
// property is cross-cutting audit data, not a rendered choice; per the
// driver-split invariant a whole-run property check is sdk).
//
// THE SPEC (read from source, NOT guessed):
//   The pairing taxonomy is the set of handler bodies that MUST co-emit, pinned
//   by tests/integration/t48-audit-event-emitters.sh:304-312 (the `check_pairing`
//   calls) — that is a STATIC source check (the literal appears in the handler
//   body). THIS test is its RUNTIME complement: the partners actually LAND in
//   audit.md across a real workflow. The handler→pair map verified at
//   t48:304-312 and aidlc-state.ts / aidlc-utility.ts:
//     handleApprove          (aidlc-state.ts:675)  -> GATE_APPROVED + STAGE_COMPLETED
//     handleCompleteWorkflow (aidlc-state.ts)       -> PHASE_COMPLETED + WORKFLOW_COMPLETED
//     handleInit             (aidlc-utility.ts)      -> WORKFLOW_STARTED + PHASE_STARTED + STAGE_STARTED
//   (handleReject -> GATE_REJECTED + STAGE_REVISING is exercised by t128, not
//   here: the driver approves every gate, so this golden-path run never rejects.)
//
//   We assert the RUNTIME pairing as a metamorphic invariant: for each pair, IF
//   the lead event fired THEN its partner(s) fired too, in the SAME run. This is
//   strictly stronger than "both events are in the taxonomy" — it proves the
//   atomic co-emission the audit trail's integrity depends on actually held over
//   a live run, not just that the literals coexist in a handler.
//
// WHY THE GOLDEN PATH HERE (and not in t128): this invariant is about the
// APPROVE/INIT/COMPLETE pairs, all of which fire on the golden path. The SDK
// driver answers every approval gate with "Approve" (its default answerScript),
// so a single drive reaches WORKFLOW_COMPLETED, exercising handleInit +
// handleApprove (per stage) + handleCompleteWorkflow — all three pair-emitting
// handlers — deterministically.
//
// THE SCOPE: `poc` — a Minimal greenfield scope (scope-mapping.json "poc") whose
// EXECUTE set is small (init×3 + reverse-engineering[->SKIP on greenfield] +
// requirements-analysis + code-generation + build-and-test) so the run reaches
// terminal WORKFLOW_COMPLETED within a generous budget while still crossing >=1
// phase boundary (Ideation present for poc, unlike bugfix) — exercising
// handleCompleteWorkflow's PHASE_COMPLETED + WORKFLOW_COMPLETED pair.
//
// IRON RULE: a missing partner is a real audit-integrity DEFECT (the trail would
// lie about an atomic transition), never softened. If the lead event never fired
// at all the test fails LOUD (vacuous-pass guard below) rather than passing on an
// empty antecedent.
//
// It SPENDS TOKENS: driveAidlc runs the real workflow on Opus/Bedrock.
