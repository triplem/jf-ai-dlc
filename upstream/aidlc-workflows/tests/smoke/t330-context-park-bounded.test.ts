//
// t330: regression guard for issue #547 — the conductor parking a workflow on
// a SUBJECTIVE sense that "context is heavy". The orchestrator skill used to
// license parking "when you are running low on context mid-loop", which is an
// unmeasurable trigger: the conductor has no access to its own token count, so
// it guessed from conversation length. Reported in the field at 37% of a 1M
// window used (63% free) — while the framework's own statusline paints that
// same reading GREEN (core/hooks/aidlc-statusline.ts contextColor(): yellow at
// >=50, red at >=75). The cost is a forced /aidlc --resume handshake every one
// or two stages.
//
// Mechanism: none. There is no tool / process / argv seam — the subject IS the
// prose contract in the shipped orchestrator skills. The failure mode (an LLM
// parking on a hunch at runtime) is behavioural and no static test can observe
// it directly. What a static test CAN pin, and what this guard exists to hold,
// is that the unbounded licence does not silently regress back INTO the source
// and that the bounded replacement keeps a numeric floor. Zero LLM, zero
// tokens, zero subprocess.
//
// Assert against SOURCE (harness/), not dist/: source is the authored
// contract, and the dist projection is regenerated from it and guarded
// separately by the package.ts `--check` drift tests. Pinning source keeps
// this guard meaningful in a worktree where dist was not rebuilt.
//
// Design note: the positive pins are substring/regex matches on the load-
// bearing clause, not the full sentence, so ordinary copy-editing does not
// fail the guard while a removal of the bound does.
