//
// t250: regression guard for the "never echo the ```question fence" contract:
// an orchestrator that dumps a fenced ` ```question ` block as LITERAL text
// instead of rendering it through the harness's question-rendering annex.
// The prohibition lives in every annex that renders structured questions:
//   - harness/claude/skills/aidlc/question-rendering.md    (AskUserQuestion)
//   - harness/codex/skills/aidlc/question-rendering.md     (request_user_input / prose)
//   - harness/kiro/skills/aidlc/question-rendering.md      (numbered prose)
//   - harness/kiro-ide/skills/aidlc/question-rendering.md  (numbered prose)
//   - harness/opencode/skills/aidlc/question-rendering.md  (numbered prose)
//   - harness/cursor/skills/aidlc/question-rendering.md    (numbered prose)
//   - core/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md        (harness-neutral § "Structured questions")
//
// Mechanism: none. There is no tool / process / argv seam: the subject IS the
// prose contract in shipped source files. The failure mode (an LLM echoing the
// fence at runtime) is a behavioural mistake no static test can observe
// directly; that is exactly why the optional runtime lint/hook was investigated
// and DEFERRED. What a static test CAN pin (and what this guard exists to hold)
// is that the strengthened prohibition does not silently regress OUT of the
// source files, and that the source fences needed for illustrative annex
// mappings and normative protocol templates are preserved so the rule never
// forbids its own authoring specs. Zero LLM, zero tokens, zero subprocess.
//
// Assert against SOURCE (core/ + harness/), not dist/: source is the authored
// contract; the dist projection is regenerated from it and guarded separately
// by the package.ts `--check` drift tests. Pinning source keeps this guard
// meaningful even in a worktree where dist was not rebuilt.
//
// Design note (substring pins, not exact prose): each assertion matches a
// short, load-bearing PHRASE (case-insensitive where natural), never a whole
// paragraph. A future copy-edit that rewords around the phrase stays green; the
// guard only trips when the CONTRACT itself is removed. Each phrase was
// confirmed present in the post-fix source at authoring time.
