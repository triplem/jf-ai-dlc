// t196-compose-inflight.sdk.test.ts - the P4 in-flight recompose journey (sdk
// live). t194 pins the deterministic verb; this proves the CONDUCTOR arc the
// SKILL.md composer block names, over a real running workflow:
//
//   seed:      an active mid-ideation feature workflow (the post-creation shape).
//   drive:     `/aidlc compose "drop market research and team formation"`.
//   engine:    Branch 4c WITH-STATE dispatch (t198 pins it does not advance).
//   conductor: dispatches the composer -> proposal (SKIP flips for the two
//              named pending stages) -> writes the pending marker -> gate
//              (answerScript approves) -> runs `recompose --skip ...` ->
//              deletes the marker.
//   disk:      the two stages' suffixes are SKIP; derived fields rebuilt;
//              RECOMPOSED audited; the marker is GONE; the cursor and every
//              checkbox marker byte-unchanged (a plan edit, not an advance).
//
// It SPENDS TOKENS - driveAidlc drives the real /aidlc on Opus/Bedrock. Gated
// on claude-CLI presence.
