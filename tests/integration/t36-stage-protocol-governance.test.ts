//
// t36 — stage-protocol governance + phase-boundary structural meta-test.
// Migrated from tests/integration/t36-stage-protocol-governance.sh (TAP plan 19).
//
// The .sh carried NO `# covers:` header (it claims no enumerated tool unit);
// it is a pure structural meta-test that the shipped governance protocol
// (dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-governance.md)
// carries §13 Phase Boundary Verification, names the three valid phase-
// transition stage pairs, references the verification knowledge file, and
// has SHED the dead guardrail-learning model (superseded by the §13 Learnings
// Ritual in stage-protocol.md — v0.5.0 milestone 15). The honest covers id is
// therefore the structural INVARIANT under test, declared free-form like
// t12's `invariant:` id (tests/integration/t12-state-fixture-validation.test.ts:1)
// and t125's invariant ids — invariant ids are descriptive claims, not joined
// to an enumerated subcommand/function unit.
//
// Mechanism: none. The .sh did `grep` / `grep -v` against on-disk shipped
// `.md` files plus `[ -f ... ]` file-existence walks — zero tool spawn, zero
// LLM, zero tokens. The twin reads the SAME shipped bytes with readFileSync /
// existsSync and asserts in-process.
//
// Subject under test (the shipped, real bytes — no temp project, no tool):
//   - dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-governance.md
//     (GOVERNANCE; AIDLC_SRC-relative — the .sh's
//      "$AIDLC_SRC/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-governance.md")
//   - dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/<slug>.md
//     (STAGES_DIR; the boundary stage files, found by walking each phase dir
//      exactly as the .sh's nested `for phase_dir in "$STAGES_DIR"/*/` loop)
//   - dist/claude/.claude/knowledge/aidlc-shared/verification.md
//     (KNOWLEDGE_DIR; the verification methodology the governance file points at)
//
// Behavioural contract verified against the shipped file
// (stage-protocol-governance.md:4,6,10,12,14,19,29,30-32,20):
//   :10  "## 13. Phase Boundary Verification" heading present
//   :4   "supplement to `stage-protocol.md`" — names the parent protocol
//   --   the dead §12 guardrail-learning model is GONE: no
//        "Guardrail Learning Protocol", no "NEVER/ALWAYS" format, no
//        "GUARDRAIL_LEARNED" emission anywhere in the file
//   :14  "### When to verify" subsection
//   :19  "### Verification process" subsection
//   :29  "### Phase boundary checks" subsection
//   :12  the three phase-transition stage pairs co-located on one line each:
//          approval-handoff → reverse-engineering   (Ideation→Inception)
//          delivery-planning → functional-design     (Inception→Construction)
//          ci-pipeline → deployment-pipeline          (Construction→Operation)
//   :20  "verification.md" referenced as the methodology file
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, every .sh `ok` -> a named test()):
//   .sh 1  (§13 Phase Boundary Verification exists)        -> "§13 Phase Boundary Verification heading is present"
//   .sh 2  (references main protocol as parent)            -> "names stage-protocol.md as the parent protocol"
//   .sh 3  (no dead Guardrail Learning Protocol)           -> "dead guardrail-learning model is gone" (sub-expect)

//   .sh 7  (### Verification process exists)               -> "carries the three §13 subsections" (sub-expect)
//   .sh 8  (### Phase boundary checks exists)              -> "carries the three §13 subsections" (sub-expect)
//   .sh 9  (Ideation→Inception boundary pair)              -> "names the three phase-transition stage pairs" (sub-expect, STRONGER: same line)
//   .sh 10 (Inception→Construction boundary pair)          -> "names the three phase-transition stage pairs" (sub-expect, STRONGER: same line)
//   .sh 11 (Construction→Operation boundary pair)          -> "names the three phase-transition stage pairs" (sub-expect, STRONGER: same line)
//   .sh 12-17 (6 boundary stages exist as files)           -> "every boundary stage exists as a file under STAGES_DIR" (sub-expect per slug; STRONGER: pins the resolved phase dir)
//   .sh 18 (references verification.md knowledge file)     -> "references the verification.md knowledge file"
//   .sh 19 (verification.md exists on disk)                -> "verification.md exists on disk under aidlc-shared"
//
// STRONGER than the original where called out:
//   - .sh 9/10/11 grepped "A.*B" (A and B somewhere, A before B). The twin
//     asserts BOTH stage names land on the SAME line of the file (the §13
//     boundary-pairs sentence at :12), which is the actual co-location the
//     grep was approximating.
//   - .sh 12-17 only asked "the file exists somewhere under STAGES_DIR". The
//     twin records WHICH phase dir resolved each slug and asserts it is one of
//     the five known phase dirs — a regression that moved a stage to a bogus
//     dir would still pass the .sh's `-f` walk but fail here.
