//
// t-journey-workspace.sdk.test.ts — the LIVE workspace journey, Claude-SDK
// logic half (P10 / Stage E). This is the ONE phase that exercises the vision's
// §0 promise as a COMPOSED lived flow rather than mechanism-by-mechanism: a
// developer opens one workspace, builds a feature that SPANS TWO REPOS, runs a
// SECOND intent alongside it, works in a NON-DEFAULT SPACE, and none of it
// collides — driven live through the real Claude harness surface.
//
// The journey (one shared on-disk workspace root carried across SDK turns; each
// driveAidlc() is a fresh SDK session operating on the SAME persisted records —
// the cross-session on-disk record state IS the proof of composition):
//   1. `/aidlc "build auth across both repos"` on a fresh two-sibling-repo
//      workspace → the engine names intent-create, the conductor runs it, and the
//      intent auto-creates spanning repo-a + repo-b. Asserted on disk: one
//      intents.json row, repos == the SORTED set ["repo-a","repo-b"], a real
//      UUIDv7, status "in-flight".
//   2. (cheaper variant the card sanctions) a reverse-engineering stage writes a
//      per-repo codekb artifact into the space-level codekb store for repo-a +
//      repo-b (aidlc/spaces/<space>/codekb/<repo>/ — the codekb-determinism
//      placement fix; codekbFiles tolerates the bare workspace-root form too) —
//      WITHOUT driving the full worktree-forking swarm (the most fragile/expensive
//      beat, which combines badly with the in-turn forwarding loop). Asserted:
//      both per-repo codekb dirs exist with content.
//   3. create a SECOND intent alongside the active one via the deterministic
//      `intent-create` verb (the engine has NO "offer a 2nd intent" directive on
//      the logic path — it would advance A via Branch 10; intent-create mints
//      unconditionally, the shared cross-harness path). Asserted: two isolated
//      registry rows + record dirs, distinct UUIDs, and A's state + audit shard
//      byte-untouched by B's creation.
//   4. `/aidlc space-create teamB` → `/aidlc space teamB` → create an intent
//      there. The two space verbs are driven the PLAIN user way — the engine now
//      routes a leading space/space-create/intent token through the conductor
//      (aidlc-orchestrate.ts Branch 1b → terminal print naming aidlc-utility.ts),
//      so no "do NOT run next" steering is needed; the conductor runs the named
//      utility and stops without touching the active intent. Asserted:
//      teamB/memory/org.md copied from default's; team.md + project.md are FRESH
//      EMPTY stubs (default's promoted learnings do NOT leak); the space-level
//      knowledge/ dir appears on the FIRST INTENT CREATION in teamB (lazy ensure-exists), NOT
//      at space-create; the active-space cursor moved.
//   5. `/aidlc space default` (again the plain conductor-routed switch) → intent A
//      is still resumable (the cursor flip is a pure write) and its audit shard is
//      intact.
//
// DRIFT NOTE (verified @ this branch, surfaced for the runbook): the engine's
// `next` flag parser (aidlc-orchestrate.ts parseNextFlags :249) does NOT
// recognise `--repos`, and createPrintDirective (:304) never threads it into the
// named intent-create command - so on the AUTO-CREATE path the repo span is
// captured by SIBLING AUTO-DISCOVERY (resolveIntentRepoSet → discoverSiblingRepos,
// lib:1299/1273), not by an explicit flag. Step 1 therefore drives the bare
// `/aidlc "<desc>"` (no --repos, which would pollute the slug as a stray
// positional) and relies on auto-discovery to capture both git-init'd siblings —
// which is the genuine composed behaviour the vision promises (an intent spanning
// the repos present in the workspace). The explicit `--repos` flag is honoured
// only on a direct `intent-create --repos` invocation (exercised by t164/unit).
//
// Assertions stay at the JOURNEY level (on-disk record state + verbatim
// tool-result bytes), tolerant of conversational variance — NEVER on
// assistantText. SPENDS TOKENS — driveAidlc drives the real /aidlc on
// Opus/Bedrock. Gated on claude-CLI presence (the file calls driveAidlc, so
// claude-gate.ts marks it SDK-dependent; the runner skips-with-reason when claude
// is absent — never a hard fail).
