// t-acp-kiro-compose-inflight.serial.test.ts - the P4 in-flight recompose
// journey on Kiro-ACP: the Kiro logic-half twin of the SDK test
// t196-compose-inflight. t196 proves the CONDUCTOR arc over the Claude SDK; this
// proves the SAME arc runs end-to-end on the shipped dist/kiro conductor, over a
// real running workflow driven through the Agent Client Protocol:
//
//   seed:      a created feature workflow (the state-initialization-done
//              fixture: cursor at intent-capture, market-research +
//              team-formation pending grid-EXECUTE ahead of it). Seeded from a
//              fixture rather than a subprocess intent-create so the deterministic
//              tier stays fixture-driven, the same posture the reviewer + front
//              twins take (a spawned aidlc tool would reclassify this file's
//              mechanism).
//   turn 1:    `/aidlc compose "drop market research and team formation ..."`.
//              The engine's WITH-STATE dispatch names the composer; the
//              conductor proposes SKIP flips for the two pending stages, writes
//              the pending marker `aidlc/.aidlc-compose-pending`, and renders the
//              approve/edit/reject gate as numbered prose. The marker is what
//              lets the turn END at the gate (the Stop hook's pending-compose
//              carve-out honours it, proven deterministically by t195). Nothing
//              is applied yet: the state file is byte-unchanged, no RECOMPOSED.
//   turn 2:    "1 (Approve ...)" on the SAME keepAlive session. The conductor
//              runs the recompose verb and DELETES the marker. Because the
//              ACP conductor's forwarding loop does not reliably end its turn on
//              its own, the stop is a DISK-CONDITION cancel: poll until the
//              RECOMPOSED audit event is present AND the marker is gone, then
//              session/cancel (the pattern t-acp-kiro-reviewer uses for the
//              in-turn forwarding hazard).
//   disk:      market-research now carries the SKIP suffix, the cursor and every
//              checkbox marker are byte-unchanged (a plan edit, not an advance),
//              Total Stages shrank, Stages to Skip names market-research,
//              RECOMPOSED is audited, and the marker is gone.
//
// JOURNEY-LEVEL tolerance (mirrors t196): the live composer exercises judgment
// over WHICH of the two named stages to flip (a run was observed keeping
// team-formation with a reason), so the deterministic contract is that at least
// the unambiguous market-research flip landed AS A SUFFIX EDIT, the plan shrank,
// and the cursor never moved. t194 pins the exact multi-flip mechanics
// deterministically. The marker is asserted absent only AFTER the turn fully
// resolves it (the disk-condition poll gates on marker-gone), avoiding the
// write-then-delete timing race t196 documents at the recompose tool result.
//
// SPENDS Kiro credits - gated AIDLC_KIRO_ACP_LIVE=1; skip-with-reason when unset
// or kiro-cli absent/unauthenticated. Serial: one live ACP session, two turns.
