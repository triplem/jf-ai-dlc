//
// t113 — complete-workflow TERMINAL-EVENT ORDERING + IDEMPOTENCY. The audit
// trail's load-bearing contract at the end of a workflow is that the final
// phase's closure events land IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
//
//     STAGE_COMPLETED -> PHASE_COMPLETED -> PHASE_VERIFIED -> WORKFLOW_COMPLETED
//
// and that WORKFLOW_COMPLETED is dead-last and fires EXACTLY ONCE. Every
// downstream consumer (the statusline, resume, CI gates, doctor) reads the
// audit tail to decide "is this workflow done?"; if a refactor reordered the
// emits in handleCompleteWorkflow (aidlc-state.ts:573-596) — e.g. moved the
// WORKFLOW_COMPLETED emit before PHASE_VERIFIED, or dropped the
// alreadyMarkedCompleted guard so the final STAGE_COMPLETED doubled — the
// counts could still look plausible while the SEQUENCE lied about what
// happened. No test today asserts this terminal ORDER, nor the re-run
// idempotency of the final approve. t51 asserts counts + "first/last event"
// + a single gate<stage ordering pair, but not the four-event terminal tail
// nor what a past-the-end approve does. This pins both.
//
// SOURCE (aidlc-state.ts):
//   - handleApprove (:675) validates the slug is `awaiting-approval` (:685),
//     flips it to [x], emits GATE_APPROVED + STAGE_COMPLETED (:703-708), then
//     auto-advances: nextInScopeStage -> handleAdvance, OR (final stage)
//     handleCompleteWorkflow (:729-739).
//   - handleCompleteWorkflow (:520) sets Status=Completed and emits, IN ORDER,
//     STAGE_COMPLETED (suppressed when alreadyMarkedCompleted, :574) ->
//     PHASE_COMPLETED (:580) -> PHASE_VERIFIED (:585) -> WORKFLOW_COMPLETED
//     (:593). For the final-stage approve path the STAGE_COMPLETED was already
//     emitted by approve (:705), so the guard suppresses the duplicate and the
//     observed terminal tail is exactly STAGE_COMPLETED -> PHASE_COMPLETED ->
//     PHASE_VERIFIED -> WORKFLOW_COMPLETED.
//
// IDEMPOTENCY — verified by probe, asserting the REAL behaviour of each seam:
//   - approve PAST THE END is idempotent: once the final slug is [x],
//     re-running `approve build-and-test` fails validateSlugInState (:685,
//     state 'completed' not 'awaiting-approval') WITHOUT reaching the terminal
//     sequence, so WORKFLOW_COMPLETED stays at exactly 1 (and no second
//     STAGE_COMPLETED lands). This is the realistic re-run scenario in the
//     deterministic walk (the orchestrator replays an approve), so it is the
//     behavioural contract pinned here. NOTE the failed approve is not a
//     silent no-op: error() routes through emitError (:1709 -> lib :1473) and
//     appends exactly ONE ERROR_LOGGED row, so the trail GROWS by one and its
//     new dead-last event is ERROR_LOGGED, not a duplicate WORKFLOW_COMPLETED.
//     The test asserts that real shape.
//   - SOURCE SURPRISE (not the asserted path, noted for the record): re-running
//     `complete-workflow build-and-test` DIRECTLY is NOT idempotent — it has no
//     already-Completed early return, and the alreadyMarkedCompleted guard
//     suppresses only the duplicate STAGE_COMPLETED, so PHASE_COMPLETED /
//     PHASE_VERIFIED / WORKFLOW_COMPLETED all re-emit, doubling the count to 2.
//     A future fix that guards handleCompleteWorkflow against an
//     already-Completed Status would make that path idempotent too; this test
//     would not break (it asserts only the approve seam).
//
// TECHNIQUE: invariant. Drive the SHORTEST scope (bugfix, 6 EXECUTE stages) from
// init to completion with NO claude — `aidlc-utility.ts init` to bootstrap, then
// gate-start -> approve per remaining stage (approve auto-advances; the final
// approve reaches handleCompleteWorkflow). Same seam t51 uses. Then parse the
// resulting audit.md and assert on the FILE bytes (never prose). bugfix has 3
// PHASE_VERIFIED (initialization, inception, construction); we assert the FINAL
// phase's terminal ordering and the singleton WORKFLOW_COMPLETED.
