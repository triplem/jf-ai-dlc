// t138-scope-exclusion-counts.test.ts — METAMORPHIC INVARIANT (§5-D, Phase 4):
// scope-exclusion counts. Drive a REAL scoped workflow through the Claude Agent
// SDK (driveAidlc) and assert, as data, that a stage marked SKIP-for-this-scope
// emits ZERO STAGE_STARTED across the WHOLE workflow.
// {sdk} mechanism (the property is audit-count data, not a rendered choice).
//
// WHY THIS IS METAMORPHIC, NOT A t53 CLONE. t53 (tests/e2e/t53.test.ts)
// proves the same family for `bugfix` by HARD-CODING IDEATION_STAGES /
// OPERATION_STAGES literals. This test is the metamorphic generalisation: it
// DERIVES the SKIP set for its scope FROM scope-grid.json at test time (the
// shipped source of truth, dist/.../tools/data/scope-grid.json), so the
// invariant tracks the data — if a future scope edit moves a stage EXECUTE->SKIP,
// this test's expectation moves with it, automatically. And it runs a DIFFERENT
// scope: `security-patch` (Minimal; its SKIP set differs from bugfix because
// nfr-requirements is EXECUTE for security-patch), so it exercises a distinct
// exclusion shape rather than re-proving bugfix's.
//
// THE INVARIANT (stated as data): let SKIP(scope) = { stage : scope-grid.json
// marks it "SKIP" } (minus the greenfield reverse-engineering downgrade, which is
// a runtime EXECUTE->SKIP not authored in the mapping — see below). Then over the
// whole run, the set of stages named in any STAGE_STARTED audit block is DISJOINT
// from SKIP(scope). Equivalently: for every SKIP stage, its STAGE_STARTED count
// is exactly 0.
//
// SOURCE-PINNED FACTS (verify-never-guess):
//   - scope grid: dist/claude/.claude/tools/data/scope-grid.json (read at test
//     time; "security-patch".stages maps each of the 32 stages to EXECUTE|SKIP).
//   - STAGE_STARTED is emitted for EXECUTE stages ONLY (aidlc-utility.ts init
//     stages + aidlc-state.ts advance); a SKIP stage gets a `[ ] <slug> — SKIP`
//     state row and NO STAGE_STARTED block (audit-format.md:33; the t53 thesis,
//     here generalised across the derived SKIP set).
//   - the audit STAGE_STARTED `**Stage**:` field names the slug (audit-format.md:33).
//   - greenfield downgrades reverse-engineering EXECUTE->SKIP at runtime
//     (aidlc-utility.ts) — a stage that is EXECUTE in the mapping but SKIP at
//     runtime on greenfield. We run on a greenfield project and EXCLUDE
//     reverse-engineering from the positive "EXECUTE stages did start" control so
//     the runtime downgrade can't red the test; it's irrelevant to the SKIP
//     disjointness assertion (the mapping's SKIP set is a subset of the runtime
//     SKIP set, so disjointness from the authored SKIP set is the weaker, sound
//     claim — a downgraded stage simply doesn't appear in STAGE_STARTED either).
//
// IRON RULE: a SKIP stage that emits a STAGE_STARTED is a real scope-routing
// DEFECT (the scope did not actually exclude it), never softened. Vacuous-pass
// guards below ensure the STAGE_STARTED class fired and the SKIP set is non-empty.
//
// It SPENDS TOKENS: driveAidlc runs the real workflow on Opus/Bedrock.
