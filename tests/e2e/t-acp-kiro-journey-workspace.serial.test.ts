// t-acp-kiro-journey-workspace.serial.test.ts — the LIVE workspace journey,
// Kiro-ACP logic half (P10 / Stage E). Proves the SAME composed §0 promise the
// SDK + Codex legs prove (one feature spanning two repos · per-repo codekb · a
// 2nd intent alongside active A · a non-default space switch + create one there + no
// collision · switch back), expressed in the ACP driver's NATIVE turn shape: a
// SEQUENCE of single-turn driveKiroAcp invocations against one shared on-disk
// workspace root, each bounded by stopAfterToolTitle at a tool boundary.
//
// The assertable surfaces are primarily verbatim tool output (tool_call_update
// text) + on-disk state. Beat 3a additionally checks the assistant's rendered
// routing question because that user-visible offer is the behavior under test;
// it uses broad semantic clauses and never pins exact wording. The inferred
// scope remains outside the invariant.
//
// ALL FIVE beats drive through the PRODUCTION `aidlc` conductor (live-verified on
// this branch, kiro-cli 2.7.0):
//
//   * Beats 1-3. Beat 3 (create a 2nd intent alongside active A) is the conductor's
//     AUTHORIZED offer→confirm routing (SKILL.md § "New work while an intent is
//     active": on a genuine new-work prose it renders an offer, and on the human's
//     "Yes" it runs `intent-create` DIRECTLY — "the same run-then-continue shape the
//     print directive already uses"). That does NOT fight the forwarding override in
//     agents/aidlc.json, so the production conductor creates the 2nd intent over a
//     keepAlive multi-turn ACP session: turn 1 auto-creates A, turn 2 (new-work)
//     stops at the offer's compare-read (`intent --json`), turn 3 (confirm) stops
//     at the creation. Live-verified: turn 3 ran `intent-create` directly; A's state
//     was byte-unchanged.
//
//   * Beats 4-5 (space-create teamB · switch · intent creation in teamB · switch back) now
//     ALSO drive through the production `aidlc` conductor — the d44828b engine fix
//     routes the workspace navigation verbs through `next`: a LEADING
//     `space`/`space-create`/`intent` token (parseNextFlags aidlc-orchestrate.ts:276,
//     WORKSPACE_VERBS:146) maps to a TERMINAL print directive naming
//     `bun .kiro/tools/aidlc-utility.ts <verb> [<arg>]` (handleNext Branch 1b ~:921,
//     placed BEFORE state inspection so it works with or without an active workflow
//     — it never advances a workflow). The `aidlc` agent's prompt rule (3) — "When a
//     directive is a print whose message names a command to run, run THAT EXACT
//     command as your immediate next tool call" — makes the live conductor honor it:
//     each beat-4/5 turn's tool calls are exactly `next <verb>` (forward) then
//     `aidlc-utility.ts <verb>` (run the named tool); zero intent-advance.
//     Live-verified 3/3 via a throwaway spike (the ndjson trace showed the two-call
//     pair for space-create/space/space default, never a `next`-advances-A). The
//     teamB creation (4c) rides the same engine seam: in teamB (zero intents) a
//     `/aidlc --scope poc "<desc>"` hits the creation gate (Branch 9a →
//     createPrintDirective ~:1231) which prints `intent-create …`; the conductor runs
//     it. Each space verb is its own single-turn driveKiroAcp call (ACP is
//     single-turn; stopAfterToolTitle catches the named tool's output). This proves
//     the ACP SURFACE carries the space-switch + isolated creation mutations live
//     through the SAME production conductor the SDK + Codex legs exercise.
//
// (There is NO Kiro-TUI leg for these beats — Kiro ships no statusline, so the
// render-half matrix is Claude only for the statusline surface; the
// multi-repo/intent/space composition is a logic-half concern proven here.)
//
// SPENDS Kiro credits — gated AIDLC_KIRO_ACP_LIVE=1; skip-with-reason when unset
// OR kiro-cli is absent/unauthenticated. Serial: one live ACP session at a time.

 *  verify (`cd …/codekb/<repo>`) right after EACH repo, so a `codekb/repo-X` title
 *  can fire after only ONE repo's artifacts exist — leaving the other repo's
 *  codekbFiles() at 0 (live-observed flake: repo-b verified + stopped before repo-a
 *  was ever written). On ACP the conductor's IN-TURN forwarding loop can also end
 *  the turn early on its own (e.g. at a question stop) or keep forwarding past the
 *  stage work (kiro-acp-drive.ts hazard), so a natural turn-end is not a reliable
 *  completion signal either way. Instead: own the session, poll the workspace for
 *  both repos' codekb (tolerant of the root OR space-scoped store — see

 *  session/prompt then resolves with stopReason=cancelled. Falls through on the
 *  drive's own timeout (the budget) if the stage never produces both stores — a
 *  real failure the assertions below catch.
 *
 *  Second cancel arm: a LEGITIMATE greenfield RE-skip. When the intent is greenfield
 *  the engine stamped reverse-engineering SKIP at creation, so this `--single` run never
 *  writes codekb and would otherwise burn the whole codekb budget (~20 min of live
 *  Kiro credits) waiting for stores that will never appear. So we also cancel the

        // they map 1:1 to an aidlc-utility.ts subcommand and carry no workflow work.
        // On Kiro they are dispatched DETERMINISTICALLY by the userPromptSubmit seam
        // (agents/aidlc.json → aidlc-kiro-adapter.ts verb-intercept): the hook runs
        // the tool OFF-BAND (not as a conductor tool call) and hands the conductor the
        // verbatim output with a do-NOT-advance instruction, so the conductor relays
        // and ends the turn making ZERO tool calls (live-verified: toolCalls=[],
        // stopReason=end_turn, the space created on disk). Therefore each verb turn is
        // driven to its natural end_turn — NOT stopAfterToolTitle (the tool runs inside
        // the hook, never surfaces as an ACP tool_call, so a title stop would never
        // fire). The assertable surface is the on-disk outcome. (Beat 4c below is a
        // CREATE: run-then-continue, genuine conductor work, so it keeps its title
        // stop.) Each verb reuses the keepAlive `space` session; the seam ends every
        // verb turn cleanly so reuse is safe.
