// covers: function:setupWorktreeFixture, function:cleanupWorktreeFixture
//
// t01 — the worktree test-harness primitives. Migrated from
// tests/e2e/t01-helpers.sh (TAP plan 7), which exercised
// tests/lib/worktree-helpers.sh before downstream worktree PRs consumed it.
// In the all-TS suite those bash helpers were ported to TypeScript in
// tests/harness/fixtures.ts; this twin proves the PORT against the same
// behavioural contract. The .sh declared no `# covers:` header — its subject
// is the harness scaffolding itself, so the covers ids name the two exported
// helper functions under test.
//
// Mechanism: NONE. These helpers are plain in-process functions (no
// process.exit / no stdout contract), so we import and call them directly and
// observe the git repo + filesystem they build. The only subprocess is the
// real `git` we shell to in order to inspect the fixture's repo state — which
// is exactly what the .sh did with `git -C "$fixture" ...`. No bun-runtime
// shell-out to a shipped aidlc-*.ts tool occurs, so the mechanism stays none.
//
// Source under test (tests/harness/fixtures.ts):
//   :168 setupWorktreeFixture(): string
//          - mkdtemp under WORKTREE_FIXTURE_PREFIX ("aidlc-worktree-"), realpath
//          - git init -q; symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main; seed README.md;
//            one "init" commit; mkdir aidlc-docs/
//          - returns the canonical (realpath) project path
//          - throws (and rm -rf's the dir) on any git failure
//   :202 cleanupWorktreeFixture(proj): void
//          - no-op on empty/whitespace path
//          - REFUSES any path whose basename does not start with the prefix
//            (defence-in-depth; mirrors worktree-helpers.sh:87-90)
//          - prunes every registered CHILD worktree (the first porcelain
//            `worktree ` line is the main checkout), then rm -rf's the parent
//          - idempotent: safe to call twice / on a missing path
//   :157 WORKTREE_FIXTURE_PREFIX = "aidlc-worktree-"
//
// The .sh's assert_worktree_at helper has no fixtures.ts counterpart (it was a
// TAP ok/not_ok wrapper, not scaffolding) — its CONTRACT (a path is registered
// as a worktree of the repo) is asserted inline here via
// `git worktree list --porcelain` containing `worktree <path>`, the exact
// porcelain grep the .sh's assert_worktree_at performed.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, every .sh assertion -> a named expect()):
//   .sh test 1  setup creates a directory                 -> "1: returns an existing directory"
//   .sh test 2  the path is a git repo                     -> "2: the fixture is a git repo"
//   .sh test 3  the repo has exactly one commit            -> "3: the fixture has exactly one commit"
//   .sh test 4  assert_worktree_at finds the main checkout -> "4: registered as a worktree of itself (main checkout)"
//   .sh test 5  adding a child worktree, it is found       -> "5: a child worktree is registered"
//   .sh test 6  cleanup refuses paths outside the prefix   -> "6: cleanup refuses a path outside the fixture prefix"
//   .sh test 7  cleanup is idempotent (remove + no-op)     -> "7: cleanup removes the fixture and is idempotent"
//
// STRONGER than the .sh: test 1 also asserts the canonical path's basename
// carries the fixture prefix; test 3 reads the rev-list count and asserts the
// exact integer 1 (the .sh string-compared "1"); the prefix is asserted to be
// the literal "aidlc-worktree-" so a rename of WORKTREE_FIXTURE_PREFIX that
// would silently disarm the cleanup guard is caught.
