// covers: stage:ideation/intent-capture
//
// t-tui-t73-intent-capture.serial.tui.test.ts — drive the IDEATION intent-capture
// stage through a REAL keystroke-driven claude TUI and prove it produces its
// on-disk artifacts (§5.1, Phase-3 journey tier). A REWRITE — not a port — of the
// shipped tests/integration/t73-stage-intent-capture.sh.
//
// WHAT THE .sh DID (and why it was a fake journey): it ran the intent-capture
// stage jump headlessly, AUTO-APPROVING the stage's AskUserQuestion gate. The user
// never answered the gate the real intent-capture stage raises; the interactive
// journey a human actually lives was NEVER exercised. This rewrite drives the
// painted gate by keystroke via the shared `answer-gate` primitive (tui-drive.ts
// §3), terminating on the on-disk intent-statement.
//
// WHY PATTERN B (multi-gate journey, answer-gate --until-file):
//   intent-capture is a GATED stage — it asks the user questions (a questions file
//   gets [Answer]: lines filled) and surfaces an AskUserQuestion menu before it
//   commits its artifacts. The journey runs multiple LLM turns and at least one
//   rendered gate, so it is NOT a single landed-and-rendered jump (Pattern A).
//   We answer every gate by taking the Recommended default and TERMINATE on the
//   on-disk intent-statement artifact — never on a screen string (§1.1: the
//   transcript is not a leading event bus; disk is the terminator).
//
// THE SEEDED REDO-JUMP (matches the .sh fixture exactly):
//   state-initialization-done.md sets Current Stage == intent-capture (the redo
//   target) with Completed=3 / 3 [x]. Because Current Stage already equals the
//   --stage target, aidlc-jump does NOT terminate the workflow on the jump; the
//   stage runs, its gate approves, and approve auto-advances to the next in-scope
//   stage (market-research). So after the journey: intent-capture flips to [x],
//   Completed climbs past 3, and Current Stage moves off intent-capture. The .sh
//   asserted exactly this (its tests 9-12). We assert equal-or-stronger.
//
// What it proves:
//   - the intent-capture stage starts from a --stage jump
//     (statusline leaves nothing-to-do and shows a live IDEATION phase),
//   - the answer-gate clears the stage's rendered AUQ menu(s) by taking the
//     Recommended default and TERMINATES on the on-disk intent-statement artifact,
//   - ON DISK (the surface the .sh greps, equal-or-stronger):
//       * <record>/ideation/intent-capture/ exists,
//       * a *questions* file exists AND carries >=1 `[Answer]:` line (the gate's
//         answers were written back, the thing the headless auto-approve faked),
//       * a *intent*statement* artifact exists, is > 100 bytes, and has at least
//         one markdown heading,
//       * both deliverables carry source tags and an Assumptions & Open
//         Questions section,
//       * aidlc-state.md Completed counter == the number of `- [x]` lines
//         (internal consistency invariant), Completed >= 4 (monotonic from the
//         fixture's 3 + this stage), and Lifecycle Phase == IDEATION,
//       * audit.md recorded a STAGE_COMPLETED for intent-capture (stronger than
//         the .sh, which never checked audit for this stage),
//   - RENDER (the tui-only value-add the SDK/claude-p path is blind to): the
//     captured grid showed the AUQ select footer (`Enter to select`) and/or the
//     multi-tab `Submit` strip at least once while the gate was up.
//
// REACHABILITY NOTE / potential FINDING: intent-capture is a normal IDEATION stage
// (not the heavy reverse-engineering stage), so a few-minute live run is expected
// to reach the intent-statement well inside the 900s budget. If the artifact never
// lands inside the overall-timeout, answer-gate exits nonzero (HANG BACKSTOP) and
// this test RED — that red is a finding about stage reachability, NOT a thing to
// soften. We assert what the stage SHOULD produce; we do not weaken to force green.
//
// COST: spends real Bedrock tokens (minutes-long LLM turns). Gated behind
// AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1 so a bare `--e2e` on a laptop SKIPs it; tmux/claude/
// distributable absence also SKIPs with a reason — never a hollow pass.
//
// SPAWN, not import (D-TUI-7): runs under bun, spawns tui-drive.ts (node on
// Windows so node-pty never loads under bun, #748; bun elsewhere). The
// answer-gate loop lives in the driver — one implementation, both backends. The
// tui-drive.ts spawn is what DERIVES the `tui` mechanism (Phase 0) — no filename
// mechanism segment. We import ONLY resolveWinNode from the driver.
