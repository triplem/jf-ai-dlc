// t-acp-kiro-reviewer.serial.test.ts — LIVE proof that the §12a reviewer step
// fires on the Kiro harness: a reviewer-declaring stage driven over ACP through
// the production `aidlc` conductor ends with the reviewer's `## Review` verdict
// appended to the primary artifact on disk.
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. The reviewer mechanism has three Kiro-side wiring
// contracts (conductor `subagent.trustedAgents` includes the two reviewer
// slugs; the reviewer agents' `fs_write` is capped to the `aidlc/spaces/**`
// workspace; the SKILL.md gate flow names the §12a step). All three are pinned
// deterministically by dist parity, but until this test NO live check proved a
// Kiro conductor actually runs the reviewer sub-agent end-to-end — the live
// reviewer evidence lived only on the Claude TUI leg (t-tui-t51-poc-scope).
// This is the Kiro logic-half twin: same stage (requirements-analysis, poc,
// `reviewer: aidlc-product-lead-agent` per its frontmatter), ACP-native shape.
//
// MECHANISM. `/aidlc --scope poc --stage requirements-analysis --single` emits
// exactly ONE run-stage directive carrying the graph node's `reviewer` +
// `reviewer_max_iterations` fields (buildRunStageDirective attaches them from
// the compiled node; Branch 4b short-circuits every mutating path, so the main
// pointer is never touched). The conductor runs the stage body, invokes the
// reviewer as a sub-agent, and the reviewer appends `## Review` to
// `requirements.md` under the seeded intent record.
//
// TURN SHAPE (the ACP hazards, both live-verified by the workspace journey):
//   1. The conductor's forwarding loop runs IN-TURN on ACP and does not
//      voluntarily end after stage work — so the stop is a DISK-CONDITION
//      cancel (poll for a verdict under `## Review`, then session/cancel),
//      the same pattern as driveCodekbUntilBothRepos, NOT a tool-title stop.
//   2. The stage's clarifying questions render as numbered PROSE in the
//      agent's text (question-rendering annex), not a protocol gate the driver
//      can answer — so the opening prompt grants one-stage self-answer
//      permission up front, and if the model still ends its turn to ask, ONE
//      bounded follow-up turn on the SAME keepAlive session answers with the
//      recommended defaults. Two turns maximum; the disk poll spans both.
//
// ASSERTABLE SURFACES (on-disk + tool trace, never prose):
//   - `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md` exists and
//     carries a `## Review` section with a READY / NOT-READY verdict — the
//     §12a contract (stage-protocol.md "Reviewer executes"), landing under
//     `aidlc/spaces/**` (the tree the reviewer's write cap names).
//   - No root-level `aidlc-docs/` appears: the retired flat layout must not
//     be resurrected by a reviewer pointed at a dead path.
//   - Some tool call in the turn references the reviewer agent slug — the
//     reviewer ran as a SUB-AGENT invocation, not conductor-inline prose.
//
// SPENDS Kiro credits — gated AIDLC_KIRO_ACP_LIVE=1; skip-with-reason when
// unset OR kiro-cli absent/unauthenticated. Serial: one live ACP session.
