// covers: subcommand:aidlc-worktree:info, subcommand:aidlc-bolt:fail
//
// CLI-contract port of tests/e2e/t11-halt-and-ask-retry-correlation.sh
// (TAP plan 6), mechanism = cli. The .sh pins the round-4 final-pass-critic
// concern that retry-then-fail must NOT mutate the rendered worktree path:
// `aidlc-worktree info --slug r` must return the SAME path across multiple
// BOLT_FAILED emissions for the same slug, with exactly ONE WORKTREE_CREATED
// in the audit (Retry re-runs in place per SKILL.md's per-Bolt loop — the
// orchestrator does NOT call `aidlc-worktree create` again on retry).
//
// Flow (mirrors the .sh setup at l34-72):
//   create worktree (slug r) → fail #1 → info → fail #2 (same slug, no new
//   create) → info → assert path identical + audit invariants.
//
// MECHANISM: this is a .cli twin — every observable is taken at the PROCESS
// boundary. `aidlc-worktree info` parses the latest WORKTREE_CREATED audit
// block, writes JSON to STDOUT via console.log, and process.exit(1)s on a
// miss (aidlc-worktree.ts:672-723). `aidlc-bolt fail` emits a BOLT_FAILED
// audit row through appendAuditEntry (aidlc-bolt.ts:457-483). `aidlc-worktree
// create` runs REAL `git worktree add` after the audit-of-intent emit
// (aidlc-worktree.ts:156-214). The retry-in-place invariant + the on-disk
// audit accumulation are genuine side-effects of running the real binaries
// against real git; an in-process twin would lose the process-exit seam and
// the multi-spawn audit-accumulation contract. So SPAWN the real tools via
// spawnSync(BUN, [TOOL, ...]) and assert on the audit.md bytes + the info JSON.
//
// FIXTURE: aidlc-worktree.ts asserts it runs from the main checkout
// (assertNotSiblingWorktree, aidlc-worktree.ts:162) and runs real git, so the
// case needs an ACTUAL git repo on `main` with one commit plus an aidlc-docs/
// dir. setupWorktreeFixture (tests/harness/fixtures.ts) builds exactly that;
// the tools are spawned with cwd = the fixture so `git rev-parse
// --show-toplevel` resolves to the main checkout. cleanupWorktreeFixture
// prunes the child worktree then rm -rf's the parent. Nothing is written under
// tests/fixtures/**.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, every .sh assertion -> a named expect):
//   .sh test 1 (l42) first info hit returns a path
//        -> "1: first info hit returns a path" (STRONGER: JSON .path is a
//           non-empty string ending in .../bolt-r, not just substring `"path":`)
//   .sh test 2 (l52) info returns the SAME path across retry attempts
//        -> "2: info returns the SAME path across retry attempts" (same: PATH1
//           === PATH2, parsed from JSON not sed)
//   .sh test 3 (l57) exactly one WORKTREE_CREATED event
//        -> "3: exactly one WORKTREE_CREATED event (retry does not re-create)"
//   .sh test 4 (l63) two BOLT_FAILED events
//        -> "4: two BOLT_FAILED events (one per retry attempt)"
//   .sh test 5 (l66) worktree preserved across multiple failures
//        -> "5: worktree preserved on disk across multiple failures"
//   .sh test 6 (l72) Bolt slug field on every emit (1 WORKTREE_CREATED + 2
//        BOLT_FAILED = 3 `**Bolt slug**: r` lines)
//        -> "6: Bolt slug field on every emit (1 WORKTREE_CREATED + 2 BOLT_FAILED)"
//
// 6 .sh asserts -> 6 test() cases. The two info reads + the create happen once
// in beforeAll so the retry-in-place sequence is exercised exactly as the .sh
// staged it (no per-test re-fork that would mask a re-create regression).
