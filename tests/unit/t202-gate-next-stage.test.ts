// covers: subcommand:aidlc-orchestrate:next
//
// t202 - the engine computes the gate's next-stage name. mechanism = cli.
//
// THE BUG: during Construction the approval gate's Approve option always read
// "Continue to Code Generation" regardless of the real next stage, because the
// "[next stage]" text was an LLM-filled placeholder the conductor guessed at and
// the run-stage directive carried no next-stage field. THE FIX: the engine
// attaches `next_stage` (aidlc-directive.ts) to every run-stage directive - the
// DISPLAY NAME of the next in-scope stage after the one being run, computed via
// nextInScopeStage (the same scope+state walk the post-approval advance uses),
// or null on the final in-scope stage. The conductor renders that value verbatim
// ("Continue to <next_stage>" / "Complete workflow"), never inferring it.
//
// SOURCE UNDER TEST (dist/claude/.claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts):
//   - buildRunStageDirective, the single run-stage build site: after building the
//     directive it computes nextInScopeStage(node.slug, scope, stateContent) and
//     sets directive.next_stage = next ? next.name : null.
//   - aidlc-directive.ts, the optional-nullable `next_stage` field on
//     RunStageDirective + its checkOptionalNullableString validation.
// The engine has zero exports, so the behaviour is observable only on the JSON
// directive the spawned engine emits to stdout - mechanism = cli: SPAWN
// `bun aidlc-orchestrate.ts next` and assert on the parsed directive, the SAME
// process boundary t116 (emit/parse) and t186 (per-unit iteration) drive.
//
// FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (mirrors t186's seedProject): each case uses a FRESH temp
// project (createTestProject) with a CLEAN single-row-per-slug state covering
// every stage in graph order (NOT the synthetic duplicate-row
// state-construction.md fixture), so the graph walk nextInScopeStage runs and the
// state checkboxes stay consistent. Current Stage pivots to the stage under test,
// marked in-flight ([-]). The `Skeleton Stance` field is recorded so
// functional-design (the feature-scope skeleton-gate stage) resolves its gate to
// a boolean and iterates rather than emitting the unresolved sentinel, isolating
// the next_stage behaviour. For feature scope every stage is EXECUTE, so the next
// in-scope stage after functional-design is nfr-requirements ("NFR Requirements")
// - exactly the label the issue expects. All temp dirs are cleaned in afterEach.
