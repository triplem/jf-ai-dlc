//
// t266-conversation-language — the CONVERSATION-LANGUAGE rule layer
// (deterministic, no-LLM, no-network). Pins the four `## Mandated` rules in
// `org.md` that make human-readable artifacts follow the conversation language
// instead of defaulting to English (#288).
//
// The rules are prose, so what CAN be pinned deterministically is the machinery
// around them: that they ship to every harness, that they stay quotable by the
// claim-sources sensor, that a delegated agent actually receives them, and that
// the English exception never regresses back to whole-file scope. Those are the
// three regression areas the review asked for — language continuity, delegated
// execution, and preservation of machine tokens.
//
// Four contracts land here:
//   (a) SHIP PARITY: all four rules live under `## Mandated` in the authored
//       `core/memory/org.md` AND byte-identically in both org.md projections of
//       every shipped harness (the engine-bundled `tools/data/memory-seed/` seed
//       and the `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` workspace shell). A harness that
//       silently drops the rule layer would leave its users on English output.
//   (b) LINE-LEVEL QUOTABILITY: each rule is ONE physical line. The
//       claim-sources sensor resolves a `[memory:M<n>]` source by stripping the
//       bullet marker from each line under the named H2 and requiring the quoted
//       rule to match an entry EXACTLY. A rule wrapped across lines can never be
//       registered as a source, so a stage that reasons from it would fail its
//       own sensor. This is the constraint that forces the one-line-per-rule
//       shape — it is easy to "improve" readability and break it.
//   (c) DELEGATED EXECUTION: a subagent never sees the conversation, so the
//       rules must arrive in its brief. The dispatch-rules PreToolUse hook is
//       that carrier; augmentDispatchRules must rewrite a delegated prompt to
//       carry all four rules verbatim.
//   (d) TOKEN SCOPE: the preserved-token rule names the real protocol tokens,
//       and the rule set does NOT reintroduce a blanket whole-file English
//       exception (the pre-review shape said "any other tool-read file", which
//       wrongly Englished Markdown artifacts that only mix in parsed islands).
//
// MECHANISM. (a)/(b)/(d) read the shipped files directly (the `none` floor).
// (c) SPAWNS the real engine CLI to create an intent into a temp project, then
// calls the shipped hook's exported pure entry in-process. Zero tokens, zero
// network.
