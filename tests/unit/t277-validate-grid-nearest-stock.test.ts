// covers: function:nearestStockScopes
//
// t277 - deterministic stock-scope distance in validate-grid.
//
// The composer's matched-vs-custom verdict used to rest on an LLM diff-count
// of the proposal against the stock grids, and the conductor could re-derive
// it post-approval with a different rule (exact equality), minting a custom
// scope for a proposal the persona's own +/-2 rule called a stock match.
// nearestStockScopes() makes the distance a validator-computed number:
// validate-grid now returns `nearest_stock` (stock scopes ranked by grid
// diff against the PROPOSAL), and both the composer and the conductor route
// on nearest_stock[0], never on their own recount.
//
// Pins:
//   1. SHAPE - nearest_stock rides every valid validate-grid result: one row
//      per stock scope, {scope, diff, differs}, sorted ascending by diff then
//      name, differs listing exactly the flipped slugs.
//   2. THE t193 BOUNDARY - stock bugfix + practices-discovery + ci-pipeline
//      (the scan-report shape that reds t193 when re-decided as custom) ranks
//      bugfix nearest at diff 2 with exactly those two slugs differing: the
//      +/-2 match rule resolves to MATCHED on the validator's number.
//   3. IDENTITY - a stock grid submitted verbatim ranks its own scope first
//      at diff 0.
//   4. CLI - the `validate-grid` JSON body carries nearest_stock (the
//      composer consumes the CLI, not the import).
//
// Mechanism: MIXED - in-process imports against the shipped grid for the
// arithmetic rows, one spawn for the CLI surface (same pattern as t190).
