// covers: subcommand:aidlc-jump:resolve
//
// CLI-contract port of tests/unit/t118-engine-differential.sh (TAP plan 38),
// mechanism = cli. The differential corpus — the WAVE CLOSE GATE for the
// v0.6.0 Wave 1 engine (aidlc-orchestrate.ts next), extended in Wave 2 milestone 9
// with the classified-stance anchor + the no-state workflow creation trio. It
// proves the deterministic engine emits, FOR EACH OF THE 9 SCOPES, the same
// scope-shaped directive the prose orchestrator (skills/aidlc/SKILL.md)
// produces today — WITH NO MODEL IN THE LOOP. It NEVER calls the LLM (the .sh
// deliberately omits run_claude; the prose-orchestrator workflow tests t50-t59
// drive the model — this corpus is their deterministic mirror).
//
// The covers id is subcommand:aidlc-jump:resolve, not aidlc-orchestrate, BY
// DESIGN: this corpus exercises the explicit-jump branch of the engine
// (`next --stage <slug>`), which DELEGATES the in-scope SKIP check + target
// resolution to `aidlc-jump.ts resolve` by shelling out (aidlc-orchestrate.ts
// emitJumpDirective -> runTool("aidlc-jump.ts", ["resolve", ...])). The
// observable under test — the verbatim `Stage "..." is skipped for scope
// "<scope>".` error in diff B, and the run-stage emitted for the tool's
// resolved target_slug in diff A — is OWNED by aidlc-jump.ts resolve
// (aidlc-jump.ts:116-119, :168-180). The engine relays it unchanged; resolve
// is the unit credited.
//
// MECHANISM: SPAWN the real engine binary via node:child_process spawnSync
// (BUN + aidlc-orchestrate.ts), mirroring the .sh's `bun "$TOOL" next ...`.
// The directive is emitted as JSON to stdout (engine emit()), so we parse the
// PROCESS-boundary stdout and assert on the parsed directive's fields — same
// observable the .sh extracted with its python3 json_field helper. An
// in-process twin would lose the spawn seam the engine relies on to relay the
// resolve subprocess's verbatim error, the very contract under test.
//
// EQUAL-OR-STRONGER PARITY (every .sh `ok` line maps to an expect() here):
//
//   Diff A — per-scope fingerprint (9 .sh asserts -> 9 test() cases):
//     .sh built ACTUAL="$KIND|$STG|$PHA|$GATE" and diffed against
//     EXPECTED="run-stage|$fp|$ph|true" in ONE assert_eq per scope. Here each
//     scope is one test() that asserts the SAME four fields against the SAME
//     frozen golden — STRONGER: instead of comparing a pipe-joined string we
//     assert each parsed field individually (kind/stage/phase/gate), so a drift
//     in any single field reds with a field-named message, and gate is checked
//     as the real JSON boolean `true` (not the string "true").
//
//   Diff B — per-scope SKIP (14 .sh asserts = 7 scopes x 2 -> 7 test() cases,
//     2 expect() each):
//     The .sh fired TWO assert lines per skipping scope: assert_eq KIND "error"
//     AND assert_contains MSG `is skipped for scope "<scope>"`. Each test() here
//     reproduces BOTH observables — kind === "error" and the verbatim resolve
//     wording — keeping the .sh's 2-ok-per-scope shape inside one case.
//     STRONGER: we additionally assert the message names the SKIPPED STAGE
//     (`Stage "<skip>"`), pinning that resolve rejected the RIGHT stage, not
//     merely some stage. enterprise + feature SKIP nothing (golden "-"), so
//     they carry no diff-B case — their negative coverage is the gate-axis
//     anchor below, exactly as the .sh notes.
//
//   Gate-axis anchor (1 .sh assert -> 1 test() case):
//     The .sh diffed "$GATE|$STG" against "false|workspace-detection" for the
//     state-pre-workspace-detection fixture (Current Stage=workspace-detection,
//     an init stage, in-flight). Here: gate === false (real boolean) AND
//     stage === "workspace-detection" — the other end of the gate axis from
//     diff A, proving gate tracks the human-judgement boundary (init stages
//     auto-proceed) and NOT the conditional-inclusion axis.
//
//   Classified-stance anchor (1 .sh assert -> 1 test() case):
//     The .sh diffed "$GATE|$STG" against "unresolved|functional-design" for
//     the state-construction-bolt1 fixture (a feature workflow parked at Current
//     Stage=functional-design — the FIRST Construction Bolt's gate, the skeleton
//     gate — with no stance recorded yet). The third gate value: gate ===
//     "unresolved" (the STRING sentinel, NOT a boolean), alongside the
//     per-fingerprint gate:true (diff A) and the init gate:false (anchor above).
//     The first Construction Bolt's gate depends on a practices-derived STANCE
//     the engine cannot compute, so it defers to the conductor's classify
//     round-trip and emits the sentinel (per the engine design). Here: gate ===
//     "unresolved" AND stage === "functional-design" AND phase ===
//     "construction" AND kind === "run-stage". STRONGER than the .sh's two-field
//     diff: the .sh read only gate + stage; we additionally pin phase and kind,
//     and assert gate is the sentinel STRING (a regression that emitted a boolean
//     gate here would slip a two-field-only diff but reds the string equality).
//
//   No-state workflow creation trio (4 .sh asserts -> 3 test() cases):
//     Every diff above seeds state then jumps; these three drive a NO-STATE
//     invocation (createTestProject makes aidlc-docs/ but NO aidlc-state.md —
//     same as the .sh's create_test_project), the workflow creation paths the Wave
//     2 cutover leans on, which sat outside the close gate (Wave-1 audit findings
//     2 & 3 slipped through here). Post-hardening, an EXPLICITLY NAMED scope on
//     a fresh workspace CREATES the workflow (a run-then-continue print naming
//     `init --scope <scope>`) rather than relaying the old circular no-state
//     error; the trio's cases:
//       (1) `next bugfix` — bare KNOWN-SCOPE positional, NOT freeform: kind ===
//           "print" AND message names `intent-create --scope bugfix` (the engine
//           recognises bugfix as the scope, finding 2, and emits the SAME
//           workflow creation print `next --scope bugfix` emits; pre-finding-2 it
//           mis-read the literal scope as prose and emitted an `ask` defaulting
//           to "feature"). P4: the named creation move is `intent-create`, not the
//           retired `init`. One test() bundles both observables.
//       (2) `next add dark mode toggle` — genuine freeform (<=5-word) intent,
//           NOT a scope name: kind === "ask" (the control proving the finding-2
//           fix narrows ONLY known-scope positionals; real prose still defers to
//           the human via ask). One ok line -> one test().
//       (3) bare `next`, no state, no target, no explicitly named scope:
//           kind === "error" (no position to advance from; creating one is
//           init's mutating job; env/default scope resolution is not a creation
//           signal). One ok -> one test().
//     STRONGER: case (1) additionally pins the run-then-continue shape of the
//     creation print, and case (3) re-pins the post-hardening guidance wording
//     verbatim, so a regression to the WRONG cause or the old circular clause
//     reds.
//
//   38 .sh asserts -> 38 .sh `ok` lines -> 9 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 21 test() cases
//   here (the 7 diff-B cases + the no-state-bugfix case each bundle 2 ok lines
//   for one observable group). Total expect() assertions exceed 38.
//
// FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (mirrors the .sh's create_test_project + seed_state_file +
// sed_i Scope-swap + cleanup_test_project per emit):
//   - emitScopeStage() builds a FRESH temp project (createTestProject, which
//     toPortablePath-converts on Windows so the project dir the tool resolves
//     through forward-slash helpers round-trips), seeds it from
//     state-initialization-done.md, and swaps ONLY the Scope field. The
//     init-done checkboxes are scope-agnostic for the jump path (resolve
//     validates SKIP against scope-mapping.json, not the checkbox suffixes), so
//     one fixture serves all 11 scopes — same single-fixture rationale as the
//     .sh. All temp dirs cleaned in afterAll.
//   - resetAidlcEnv() runs first (mirrors the .sh's reset_aidlc_env): scope is
//     partly resolved from AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE, so a developer's exported
//     value must not shadow the seeded fixtures. Each spawn also passes a clean
//     env with that var deleted so the seeded Scope field is authoritative.
//   - NOTHING is written under tests/fixtures/**.
