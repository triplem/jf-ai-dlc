// t273: SCOPE-AWARE PHASE DIRS at intent creation (deterministic, no-LLM,
// no-network). Intent creation used to mkdir all five phase dirs unconditionally,
// so narrow-scope records shipped empty phase dirs that read as
// planned-then-skipped work. Creation now makes a phase dir only for a phase the
// SCOPE RUNS (one holding at least one EXECUTE stage), derived from the same
// stagesInScope data that drives the PHASE_SKIPPED audit rows. Bugfix now omits
// `ideation/` but includes `operation/` for its deployment stages.
//
// Five contracts land here:
//   (a) NARROW SCOPE: a bugfix record has initialization/inception/construction/
//       operation + verification, and NO ideation/ dir at all.
//   (b) FULL SCOPE: a feature record still has all five phase dirs.
//   (c) AGREEMENT: the phase dirs on disk and the PHASE_SKIPPED audit rows are
//       exact complements. This is the invariant that makes the trimming
//       auditable rather than lossy, and it is what a future scope-grid edit
//       would break silently if only (a)/(b) were pinned.
//   (d) ADDITIVE ONLY: a pre-existing record already carrying all five dirs
//       (a legacy install) is never pruned.
//   (e) ABSENCE IS WRITABLE: an artifact write into an EXCLUDED phase's dir
//       still succeeds, because writers create their own parent chain. This is
//       the disproof case for "trimming the dir breaks a late write".
//
// MECHANISM. SPAWNs the real shipped engine CLI (`aidlc-utility.ts intent-create`)
// against temp project dirs, so the actual creation path runs end to end and the
// assertions read disk truth. Zero tokens, zero network.
