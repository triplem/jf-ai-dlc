// t217 - reviewer read-scope bound. On per-unit stages the architecture
// reviewer's cost was growing O(N) with unit count because §12a passed
// only the produces paths and the persona pushed a "cross-reference
// everything" sweep. This test pins the four surfaces that carry the
// bound - protocol, persona, knowledge, orchestrator - so a well-meaning
// prose sweep cannot silently drop it.
// The persona file is the load-bearing surface on Claude Code and Codex (Kiro additionally auto-loads the knowledge file via its agent JSON resources); keep the bound in the persona, not knowledge-only.
