// t16 — shipped phase-rules file STRUCTURE contract. Migrated from
// tests/unit/t16-phase-rules-structure.sh (TAP plan 12 — 3 distinct
// invariants across the 4 phase rule files). The .sh resolved
//   RULES_DIR  = $AIDLC_SRC/rules
//   STAGES_DIR = $AIDLC_SRC/aidlc-common/stages
// where $AIDLC_SRC = <repo>/dist/claude/.claude (fixtures.ts:42), and for
// each of the four non-initialization phases asserted three things:
//   Part 1 (.sh L17-19): rules/aidlc-phase-<phase>.md EXISTS.
//   Part 2 (.sh L25-28): that file is NON-EMPTY (wc -c > 0).
//   Part 3 (.sh L34-64): the file REFERENCES at least one stage slug that
//                        exists on disk for that phase — either an exact
//                        substring of the slug, or (fallback) any 4+ char
//                        hyphen-separated word from a slug, matched
//                        case-insensitively.
//
// Mechanism: none. This is a pure structural/file-inspection check over the
// shipped bytes — do the four phase rule files exist, carry content, and
// mention their phase's stages? No process boundary, no argv/exit/stdout
// seam, no LLM, zero tokens. We resolve the SAME trees the .sh resolved
// (AIDLC_SRC = <repo>/dist/claude/.claude, fixtures.ts:42), enumerate the
// real stage `.md` files per phase from disk, and read the real rule-file
// bytes in-process.
//
// Subject under test (the shipped distributable):
//   - dist/claude/.claude/rules/aidlc-phase-{ideation,inception,construction,
//     operation}.md           — the four per-phase rule files.
//   - dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/*.md — the stage files
//     whose slugs the rule files must mention.
//
// Part-3 algorithm parity (.sh L34-64): the .sh iterated the phase's stage
// files in shell-glob order, testing exact-substring first (`grep -qF`), then
// falling back to per-word case-insensitive match for any hyphen-segment of
// length >= 4, stopping at the FIRST slug that matched. It does NOT require
// every slug to be referenced — only that AT LEAST ONE is. This twin
// reproduces that exact predicate (referencesAnyStage) over the same bytes,
// which is equal-or-stronger: it asserts the same "at least one stage
// referenced" contract AND additionally pins, per phase, the specific slug +
// matched word the current shipped files satisfy it through (caught from the
// live disk at authoring time: feasibility[exact] / requirements[word] /
// test[word] / deployment[word]) so a silent edit that drops the reference
// is caught with a precise message.
//
// Test-design note (house style): assert the OBSERVABLE shipped contract the
// .sh asserted against the real bytes on disk. The phase list and the
// per-phase stage rosters are enumerated FROM DISK (not hard-coded) exactly
// as the .sh's `for phase in ...` + glob did.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, no guarantee dropped; the .sh emitted 3
// loops of 4 `ok` lines each = 12. Here each of the 3 invariants is one
// test() that asserts across ALL 4 phases via expect() per phase, so every
// one of the 12 .sh rows maps to a named expect(). The final test re-counts
// to pin the plan):
//   .sh L17-19 (4 phase files exist)             -> "each phase rule file exists" [4 expects]
//   .sh L25-28 (each is non-empty)               -> "each phase rule file is non-empty" [4 expects]
//   .sh L34-64 (each references a stage slug)     -> "each phase rule file references at least one of its stage slugs" [4 expects]
//   .sh L11    plan 12                            -> "covers EXACTLY 4 phases × 3 invariants = 12 assertions (TAP plan parity)"
