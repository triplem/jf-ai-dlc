// covers: voice-layer:contract-parity
//
// t274 — VOICE-LAYER PARITY + JARGON GATE. Mechanism: none (readFileSync over
// authored prose, zero spawn, zero LLM, zero tokens). Technique: deterministic
// closed predicate over the manifest-discovered harness matrix, so a new
// harness cannot escape the gate.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the conductor's chat voice is prose, and prose drifts
// silently. Three failure modes this closes:
//
//   (a) The voice contract lives in ONE place (the stage protocol every harness
//       loads on every stage). If it is deleted or renamed, no other test
//       notices — the framework keeps working and just starts talking like a
//       framework again. §1 pins the section and its substance.
//   (b) The six authored SKILLs are near-copies maintained by hand. The
//       identity paragraph that points at the contract must be present and
//       WORD-IDENTICAL in all five: a partial edit (the t181 failure mode) would
//       leave some harnesses on the old framework-voice identity. §2 extracts the
//       shared core and compares it across the matrix.
//   (c) The retired framework-voice phrases must not creep back into the
//       user-visible surfaces this effort rewrote. §3 is a deny-list scoped to
//       exactly those authored files/sections — machine-facing uses of the same
//       words elsewhere (the engine's own comments, docs/, reference chapters)
//       stay legal by construction, because they are outside the scanned set.
//
// The gate reads the AUTHORED surfaces; dist is their byte-parity-guarded copy
// (t145 / package.ts --check), so gating the authored source covers every tree.
