// custom-harness.ts — the Harness-Engineer fixture (Phase 5).
//
// Models what a HARNESS ENGINEER does (docs/harness-engineering/00-overview.md): reshape the
// framework WITHOUT code by editing DATA — define their own workflow (a custom
// scope), the stages it runs (custom stages), HOW STAGES JOIN UP (requires_stage
// edges + a produce->consume artefact chain), what artefacts get produced (each
// stage's produces:), the custom agent that leads the work, the custom knowledge
// that agent reads, a deterministic check bound to a stage (a custom sensor), and
// a standing rule. "stages are *what*, agents are *who*". "Harness Engineer" is a
// PERSONA / reader role, NOT a scope; the custom scope this fixture seeds is a
// realistic domain workflow: `data-migration`.
//
// THE SEEDED WORKFLOW — a database migration, two stages that chain:
//
//   schema-snapshot stage  ──produces──>  source-schema artefact
//          │                                     │
//          │ requires_stage                      │ consumes
//          ▼                                     ▼
//   migration-plan stage   ──produces──>  migration-strategy artefact
//
//   • schema-snapshot (the "capture the source DB shape" activity) writes the
//     `source-schema` artefact — the inventory of tables/columns to migrate.
//   • migration-plan (the "plan the cutover" activity) READS source-schema and
//     writes the `migration-strategy` artefact — the ordered cutover plan.
//
// Note the deliberate slug≠artefact split, matching shipped convention (the
// `intent-capture` stage produces `intent-statement`, not "intent-capture"):
// the STAGE is the activity, the ARTEFACT is the named deliverable it emits.
// migration-strategy's required consume (source-schema) is satisfied by an
// ON-PATH producer (schema-snapshot), so validateScope stays clean — the "be
// accurate, seed artefacts that match the scope" requirement is met by
// construction (no orphan consume, no off-path producer).
//
// Both seeders cpSync the shipped dist/claude/.claude into <proj>/.claude FIRST;
// this module then EDITS that copy and recompiles the graph. It is shared by
// setupIntegrationProject({ customHarness: true }) (sdk) and
// setupTuiProject({ customHarness: true }) (tui) — one seeding surface, no
// duplication, so the {sdk,tui} two-driver test drives byte-identical config.
//
// EVERY shape below was verified against the shipped sources before coding
// (the "shipped shapes ARE the spec" discipline):
//   - scope metadata/routing shape .... scopes/aidlc-bugfix.md +
//     aidlc-common/stages/* `scopes:` frontmatter transposed into scope-grid
//   - stage frontmatter required set .. tools/aidlc-stage-schema.ts:75-88
//     (REQUIRED_FIELDS: slug,phase,execution,condition,lead_agent,support_agents,
//      mode,produces,consumes,requires_stage,inputs,outputs; sensors OPTIONAL at
//      :90; the presence check that emits "missing required field" is at :142)
//   - consumes[] authoring shape ...... a list of { artifact, required } maps
//     (verified against the shipped market-research.md frontmatter)
//   - sensor manifest shape ........... sensors/aidlc-required-sections.md +
//     aidlc-sensor-schema.ts (id,kind,command,default_severity,description,
//     matches?; NO applies_to — that's a fossil)
//   - stage-graph seeding ............. compileStageGraph harvests {number,name}
//     from existing JSON for known slugs; a NEW slug is AUTO-SEEDED (next free
//     per-phase index + title-cased name). This fixture still pre-seeds explicit
//     {slug,number,name} rows so the custom stages land at DETERMINISTIC numbers
//     that satisfy the edge-local invariant below, auto-seed would append them
//     at the end of their phase, which is fine for leaf stages but not for the
//     hand-chosen ordering this fixture asserts.
//   - agent lookup ................... aidlc-graph.ts compile calls loadAgents()
//     and validates lead_agent/support_agents against the copied .claude/agents/
//     directory; the custom agent must be written before stage compile.
//   - edge-local invariant ............ aidlc-graph.ts:996 (every requires_stage
//     dep must be LOWER-numbered than the stage; numericStageOrder :877-882
//     splits on "." and parseInts each part, so 2.05 sorts AFTER 2.1 —
//     parseInt("05")=5 > parseInt("1")=1. The two stages are 2.0 and 2.9; the
//     shipped inception stages 2.1-2.8 are SKIP in this scope, so the only live
//     edge is 2.0->2.9, and numericStageOrder("2.0","2.9") < 0 satisfies it.)
//   - reachability .................... aidlc-utility.ts:1995-2002 + :2179 —
//     init marks every initialization-phase stage [x] complete and
//     determineFirstPostInitStage SKIPS init-phase stages, so a custom stage
//     must be a NON-init stage AND the lowest-numbered non-init EXECUTE in its
//     scope to become Current Stage (firstPostInit) at init. schema-snapshot at
//     2.0 (inception) is the lowest non-init EXECUTE -> init writes
//     Current Stage=schema-snapshot. migration-plan (2.10) is reached after
//     schema-snapshot's gate.
//   - sensor->stage binding ........... stage frontmatter `sensors: [<id>]` only
//     (aidlc-graph.ts:497 resolveSensorsForStage); manifest `matches:` glob is
//     the fire filter (aidlc-run-sensors.ts:198)
//
// The recipe was proven end-to-end in a throwaway project: compile succeeds,
// `aidlc-graph scope data-migration` routes exactly [workspace-scaffold,
// workspace-detection, state-init, schema-snapshot, migration-plan], a real
// `init --scope data-migration` writes Current Stage=schema-snapshot, and the
// compiled schema-snapshot node carries schema-validator in sensors_applicable +
// aidlc-project.md in rules_in_context.

# ${CUSTOM_AGENT_DISPLAY}

You specialize in database migration planning. You produce concise migration
artefacts from source-schema facts, with special attention to data-quality
normalization and cutover sequencing.

## Knowledge Loading

On activation, load knowledge in this order:
1. \`.claude/rules/\` -- standing guardrails and project rules
2. \`.claude/knowledge/aidlc-shared/\` -- shared methodology
3. \`${CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE_REF}\` -- custom migration playbook for this fixture
4. \`aidlc/knowledge/${CUSTOM_AGENT_SLUG}/\` -- team-owned custom knowledge, if present

## Key Principle

Before writing a custom data-migration artefact, read the custom migration
playbook and quote its \`Knowledge marker\` value in the artefact's Origin
section.

Knowledge marker: ${CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE_MARKER}

When planning a data migration, normalize legacy enum values before cutover:

- \`pending_paid\` becomes \`pending\`.
- \`voided_old\` becomes \`voided\`.

Every artefact that uses this playbook must quote the Knowledge marker value in
its \`## Origin\` section so the harness can verify the custom knowledge reached

# ${SNAPSHOT_STAGE_NAME} (custom stage)

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Capture the ${SNAPSHOT_ARTIFACT} artefact

Before writing, read \`${CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE_REF}\`. In the \`## Origin\` section,
quote the \`Knowledge marker\` value from that file exactly.

Write a markdown file to \`${SNAPSHOT_OUTPUT_REL}\` capturing the source
database's schema (the tables/columns to migrate). This test fixture is
self-contained: use the seeded source facts below and do NOT ask the user for
additional schema details.

Seeded source facts:
- Engine: PostgreSQL 14.
- Table \`accounts\`: \`id uuid primary key\`, \`email text not null unique\`,
  \`created_at timestamptz not null\`; approximately 12,000 rows.
- Table \`invoices\`: \`id uuid primary key\`,
  \`account_id uuid references accounts(id)\`, \`total_cents integer not null\`,
  \`status text not null\`; approximately 48,000 rows.
- Known data-quality issue: \`invoices.status\` includes legacy values
  \`pending_paid\` and \`voided_old\` that the migration plan must normalize.

Include at least two H2 headings: a \`## Summary\` section and an \`## Origin\`
section. The Origin section MUST cite this stage as its origin, per the project
rule ${CUSTOM_RULE_MARKER}, and MUST include the knowledge marker read from the
custom knowledge file.

### Step 2: Update state

Mark ${SNAPSHOT_STAGE_SLUG} as \`[x]\` completed in \`aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md\`
and present the standard approval gate.

## Sensors

This stage imports the custom \`${CUSTOM_SENSOR_ID}\` sensor, which fires on the
artefact write in Step 1 (its \`matches:\` glob covers the aidlc-docs tree).

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Read the upstream ${SNAPSHOT_ARTIFACT} artefact

This stage CONSUMES the \`${SNAPSHOT_ARTIFACT}\` artefact produced by the
${SNAPSHOT_STAGE_SLUG} stage. Read \`${SNAPSHOT_OUTPUT_REL}\` before planning.
Also read \`${CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE_REF}\` and apply its normalization playbook.

### Step 2: Produce the ${PLAN_ARTIFACT} artefact

Write a markdown file to \`${PLAN_OUTPUT_REL}\` describing the ordered cutover
plan built from the source schema. Include at least two H2 headings: a
\`## Summary\` section and an \`## Origin\` section. The Origin section MUST cite
this stage as its origin, per the project rule ${CUSTOM_RULE_MARKER}, and MUST
include the \`Knowledge marker\` value from the custom knowledge file.

### Step 3: Update state

Mark ${PLAN_STAGE_SLUG} as \`[x]\` completed in \`aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md\`
and present the standard approval gate.

## Sensors

This stage imports the custom \`${CUSTOM_SENSOR_ID}\` sensor, which fires on the
